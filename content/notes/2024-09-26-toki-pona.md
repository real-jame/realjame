I've been learning Toki Pona for the last week. It's a really interesting language.<!--more-->

[A post I read the other day](https://dead.garden/blog/toki-pona-and-the-small-net-a-match-made-in-span-classlinja-pona-titlema-sewi---heaven-in-toki-ponama-sewispa.html) describes Toki Pona better, so please read the explanation there if you wish to know more. But to quote:

> Toki Pona is a [constructed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) invented by linguist Sonja Lang in 2001. Its defining feature is its incredibly limited vocabulary â€“ there are only around 120 words in the entire language. It has a very limited set of grammatical rules and is easily learned within a week or so.

It really is easy to learn. I picked it up in a few hours by calling a friend who also wanted to figure out how it works, and we translated sentences and went through the dictionary together. I also watched a video by RobWords as sort of a primer on the language's history and community. I really like [jan Kekan San's lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J93GWOMbgdg&list=PLoLQoll2U6WEeCO7C2oc1LTWgkoBC8rvT) and [jan Polijan's vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRAyOPWMheY) for learning.

The community is very friendly, too.

I find it really fun to try translating things. It's almost like a puzzle to describe complex concepts in the limited selection of words.

I haven't spoken to anyone in Toki Pona yet. I hope I can do that soon.
