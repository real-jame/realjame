Here's some random tips about the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 I have that I want to note down. Like random hotkeys and stuff.<!--more-->

- Fn lock (flips what happens when you press the function key row with or without Fn): Fn + Caps Lock. There's no indicator when you do it.
- Brightness hotkey: Fn + Backspace to lower, Fn + Delete to raise.
- A microSD slot is hidden below the charger port, you need to open the kickstand to access it.
- There is no boot menu in UEFI, you have to go into the UEFI options and change the boot order. And it seems to reset every restart, which is annoying.
- The charger block I have features a USB-A port, but it's not recognized by the laptop. It just lets the block double as a USB block.
