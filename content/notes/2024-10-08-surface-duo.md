> The company threw in the towel with Android phone hardware last year when it decided to cut back on the Surface device portfolio, leading to the departure of ex-Windows and Surface boss Panos Panay. Since then, Microsoft has brushed Surface Duo under the rug, and now the Surface Duo 2 has received its final security update ahead of the end of support date on October 21, meaning no more support is planned. 

> And that marks the true end to Surface Duo. The product line is dead, and Microsoft has no intention of reviving it with future Android phone hardware. This is the second time that Microsoft has abandoned a phone business, the first time being with Windows Phone and Lumia in 2017.

[The Surface Duo is dead â€” Microsoft pulls plug on $1,500 Surface Duo 2 after just one Android OS upgrade (Windows Central)](https://www.windowscentral.com/phones/the-surface-duo-is-dead-microsoft-pulls-plug-on-usd1-500-surface-duo-2-after-just-one-android-os-upgrade)

I was trying to rock a used [Surface Pro 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro_4) just because I was in love with 2-in-1 detachable hardware at the time. Honestly, I still am, but it was rough trying to seriously use it. Linux just didn't work. People say Linux doesn't work well on Surfaces -- I had no idea how much they meant it. It was just so awful. The hardware support, mainly. It's either that or Windows 10, which ran somewhat fine, except the SP4 was also endemic to display issues if you use the device too much.

I switched to a Lenovo Thinkpad T480s a month or 2 ago, and it's seriously the best. Runs Linux like a charm, is vastly more upgradable, and features a touchscreen (one of the things I liked). These are different hardware formats of course, and (besides getting my 2-in-1 fill) the fact it had good Linux support and upgradability was worth it. And no hardware defects!

Now, the Surface Duo 2 ends support after the promised 3 years with no sign of a 3rd model. And there won't be one, because they cut back heavy. Why anyone would stay loyal to Microsoft hardware is beyond me, honestly.

Okay, well I'm pretty hung up on Linux support and upgradability. Modern Surface laptops with ARM chips seem pretty cool, and there's not really anyone else making 2-in-1's besides Microsoft, huh? Unless you want a watered down experience with an iPad and keyboard cover.

But in my opinion, if you don't absolutely need a 2-in-1, just get something else. You're paying a lot more for that form factor, and sacrificing power.

I'm not going anywhere with this, that was just a topic I never talked about before for some reason.

About the Surface phones, it was definitely a funny thing to see Microsoft make Android hardware. I guess it made sense for them to jump in with foldables - the hot new thing at the time. Otherwise, they'd just be another drop in the bucket. They still were, but less so.

Was there really that strong an integration with Microsoft stuff? This seems to be a problem with everyone who isn't Apple. You don't get much more by owning both a Surface laptop and phone, vs. owning a Samsung, Google Pixel, or even iPhone. The Surface Duo is mostly just a foldable phone with Microsoft apps preinstalled. So [like](https://www.samsung.com/levant/smartphones/galaxy-fold/) [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS10001915/)?

Anyway, with that, Microsoft's phone line goes down again.

They should try bringing back Windows Phone (unironically, I wanna see it).
