<!-- i promised i would write more articles, but the main reason i'm writing about something as dumb as this is because Nick of nick64.me was the aforementioned friend and he said i should write a post about the game after I played it in vc with him, so here you go :^) -->
*Can you do it?* Click to Ten is a game I found on my friend's Steam profile - he only had 1 minute of playtime, yet he told me he beat it! How can that be? Is it really that easy to click to ten?<!--more-->

I had to find out. And the game was free, too.

Look at the trailer, this game *has* to be good!

I installed it, and the worry set in as I slowly clicked.

One more. So close, yet so far. What could happen? Would it be a jumpscare? A funny image, maybe? Or what about a Steam achievement? There was only one way to find out.

So, I clicked.

Spoiler alert by the way.

## The last click...

I carefully lowered my index finger onto the mouse. I felt the cool plastic of the device soothe my nervous jitter. My curiousity was overtaking me. I summoned my courage, and pushed down with a cautious force. *Click.*

...And then the game closed.

Yeah thats what it does it just closes the game. No wonder he beat it in a minute.
