Well, secret is a real stretch of the word. It's private, but I'm not doing anything to hide it.

The videos aren't unlisted or anything, it's just that I'm not sharing it here, and I'll try a little bit (but not too much) to not make it show up if you search for "realjame" on YouTube.

Things will probably change in the future though. I've started to share it with my friends, maybe I'll link to it on my Mastodon (but followers-only) after a dozen videos and the qualty is a bit better.

I'll write more later, but I'm really liking how I can just talk to the camera without having to put any extra effort in. It feels much less permanent than writing on here, I feel like.

That's all for now.
