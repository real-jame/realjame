Here's some random details about the Surface Pro 4 I have that I want to note down. Like random hotkeys and stuff.

- Fn lock (flips what happens when you press the function key row with or without Fn): Fn + Caps Lock. There's no indicator when you do it.
- Brightness hotkey: Fn + Backspace to lower, Fn + Delete to raise.
- The macro on F6 seems to be useless? The manual says its for a share, but it doesn't do anything. I feel like it would open the Windows 8 Charms menu, except this laptop never supported 8.
- A microSD slot is hidden below the charger port, you need to open the kickstand to access it.
- There is no boot menu in UEFI, you have to go into the UEFI options and change the boot order. And it seems to reset every restart, which is annoying.
- The charger block I have features a USB port, but the laptop doesn't recognize it. It seems to just be for power, thanks I guess?
