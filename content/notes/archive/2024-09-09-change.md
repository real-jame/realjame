Change worries me. I know it's important. Things are changing around me, I'm changing in response, it's still worrying. But I *want* to change.<!--more-->

Change is hard, basically, and I need to do the hard things. Things are challenging a lot of times, but I've been pushing on. I'm proud of where I've been heading.

When I fall back to old habits - if I stop moving, the worry returns and tries to pull me back. I don't want to do that, but it's easy!

I don't know where I'm going with this exactly, but I want to write things like this, and be open about it. Because I'm moving forward, and picking up things, and I think that is pretty good. You do new things, meet new people, change who you are. And it's good change.

That one picture with the dog in an ocean, "it's going to be okay, but it's going to be different". Where I'm heading will be far better than where I currently am. Actually, being on this path is better than where I was before it!

So I hope everyone's doing well, I think I'm figuring things out somewhat. Hey, at least it's something.
