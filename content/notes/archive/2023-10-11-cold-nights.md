<!-- I'm not just talking about the weather with the final sentence (not the caption). I hope that was implied. -->
<!-- I've said sometimes in calls to my friends that things will get "funky" in maybe 20 years -->
<!-- There are a lot of hot topics right now about things that could genuinely snowball and get worse in that time. -->
<!-- There needs to be people to take notice and put effort into resisting. And for many other things, it's about resisting those who are trying to resist. -->
<!-- I don't want to be in Florida by that time. Although, politics aren't the main reason I'm moving.  -->
<!-- I really do just prefer cold weather. -->
I thought to write something about this because someone on Mastodon noted it in a post: the nights in Florida are growing cold. He wrote a thread that I'd like to share, about a change in pace for the place I live.

> In wonderful news my window is open and air that’s around 20C / 69F is breezing its way in. That makes me very happy.
> Window is still open. All day the breeze has been terrific. I live in Florida! (Northeast) October-April can be really wonderful here. (Strictly talking about weather. The people and the government are atrocious.)

Sep 30:
> Another day in the comfort zone of no heat & no AC. I probably won’t continue to post every cool and comfortable day in a toot, but I am noting them in my calendar. It’s a form of gratitude journaling. There is a lot I don’t like about my building, town, county, state, and nation. If it were easy I would live elsewhere with no hesitation. Reminding myself of what feels good about here helps.

Oct 1:
> Since I’m feeling kinda down today I’ll return to the comfortable weather. The breezes continue. Windows open for at least the last 72 hours here in northeast Florida. It’s 6:45 pm and I just decided I need socks to warm my tootsies. (Going barefoot at home is my preference for keeping cool during summer.)
> The weather cycle happens every year and every year it’s a pleasant surprise!

> Oh! Also today my bed received a cover for the first time since May. My summer bedding is cool sheets only. (I don’t use AC any more than I have to.)

And finally Oct 6, where I saw the post:
> Going on one week of 24/7 fully open windows, no heat or AC, here in northeast Florida (Jacksonville). I like keeping track of this info so I am entering Perfect Weather as an all day event into my calendar, set to repeat yearly. Next year I can compare.

Amazing! I actually happen to live near Jacksonville, so I opened my window at night and...

I relished as the elusive chill filled my room. That was one of the best nights of sleep I've had in years.

It makes me think back to Washington. After all, cold like that is the norm, not relegated to a few weeks or months a year.

I hope to move back someday. However long it will take.

*Things are tolerable for a change, but for how long?*
