It's a very well written post about the misconceptions of Bluesky's [AT Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol), the protocol enabling decentralization (independent of [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub), which is used as a source of comparison throughout the article).<!--more-->

Please read the FAQ at the bottom, it is the most useful part for majority of people (especially curious Fediverse users like me).

Also, the post was published *in* ATProto, which is pretty cool. It seems that there are already a lot of (experimental) platforms on the protocol, such as [this blogging platform (WhiteWind)](https://whtwnd.com/) and [frontpage.fyi](https://frontpage.fyi/), a Hacker News clone.
