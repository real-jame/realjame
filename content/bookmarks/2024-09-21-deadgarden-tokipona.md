Pretty good article! It's about how Toki Pona has surprising similarities to the indie web philosophy.<!--more-->

I was shared it by my [friend James](https://jamesg.blog/) because I've been learning Toki Pona (as expressed in a later post, lol).

Not really much to say, but I can see what Jo is getting at here. And I'm craving interesting Toki Pona media like this, so hopefully I can find more. ðŸ‘Œ
