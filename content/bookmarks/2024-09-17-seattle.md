You can tell this video was made in the late 2000s, and I love that.<!--more-->

It's a video from December 2008 of someone (JCVdude is the channel name) driving through Seattle on a highway. It's in 4:3 480p maximum, and everything looks even more drab and blue than usual, which I think is due to the camera and video quality.

Also, there's funky music playing throughout the video, I actually really like it. Maybe more random videos should have funky music? I mean otherwise, this video would have just been the sound of cars driving. I especially like the song at the end (around 7:15).

So yeah, good video. Also, I just like the pacific northwest, it's really beautiful.

Maybe I'll try digging up more late 2000s videos in the future.
