I started playing a new campaign with friends lately. Not much to say. Dungeons & Dragons is fun if you're a certain kind of person.

- Do you like writing (fantasy) characters?
- Do you want a more personalized and freeform experience than any other media can provide?
- Do you have a group of friends you could imagine going on adventures with?
- The main question, really, is, do you have a good imagination? Do you *want* a good imagination?

Then you'd probably love D&D, give it a try.
