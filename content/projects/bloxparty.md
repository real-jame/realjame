# Blox Party (alpha)

Blox Party is a physics party game for 2010+ Roblox, made by me!

## Synopsis

It's about 4 teams using balls and other tools to knock down blocks for points. Whoever has the most points wins.

At least, that's the main idea. It's pretty modular, so I can make all kinds of custom game modes, objectives, block types, tools, etc. For example, a Peggle mode I made. And those mechanics can then be included in any level!

But the main thing is tearing down piles of blocks to get the most points. It's heavily inspired by Boom Blox, one of my favorite Wii games as a kid.

## More info

- I'm making this in 2010L, so it will work on 2010+ clients. I won't test lower, but it might work with some tweaks because this game doesn't rely on GUI (yet??)
- Assets are local, so I'll distribute separate releases for use on [Novetus](https://bitl.itch.io/novetus) and [Only Retro Roblox Here](https://onlyretrorobloxhere.itch.io/orrh) - one for Novetus shareddata, and one as an ORRH asset pack. I'm thinking about how to make this process easier for me.
