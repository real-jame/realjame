Spooking Out, but you can play it on modern Roblox, so you get all those benefits like it's more accessible, no need to deal with hosting servers. In exchange for the main allure of the game, but oh well. Porting old games are fun projects to do.
I also went and integrated some modern features:

- **Mobile, controller, and Xbox support**
- GUI buttons
- Invite friends in-game
- Badges
