# Nice seeing ya here!

<!-- ![A drawing of an anthro blue dragonfly](/resources/misc/me.png "Possibly me") -->

Yet another computer toucher on the internet.

I like making things in old versions of Roblox. I run a [wiki](https://rbxlegacy.wiki/index.php/Roblox) for it, and a lot of my other personal projects are for it (games, developer tooling). At least, if I can finish any??  I'm very slow to make things. Continuously sleep deprived for no reason.

I'm not normal about insects. Especially [odonata](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/47792-Odonata)

Check the sidebar for what's on this website, as well as the projects I've made.

## latest posts...

My posts are split into 3 feeds:

- Blog: More elaborate posts
- Bookmarks: Web findings that I just have to share.
- Notes: Shorter, sloppier writings and/or niche things

I would like to post more in the future.
