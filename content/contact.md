# About me

I'm James, online I like to be called Jame or just "j", but whatever. I'll be a student at the University of South Florida to study computer science in a few months, it'll be fun!
Until then, I'm trying to be more active and work on stuff. Not only programming stuff, but making games for old versions of Roblox, and I'm also having fun with getting into writing, drawing, and making videos. I probably won't share those for a while, but the process is fun.

# Contact me

I'm on a bunch of other sites, but you can reach me best via Mastodon, Discord, or e-mail.
