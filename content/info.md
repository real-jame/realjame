<!-- ## About me

I'm James, online I like to be called Jame or just "j", but it doesn't matter.

I'm trying to be more active and work on stuff. Not only programming stuff, but making games for old versions of Roblox, and I'm also having fun with getting into writing, drawing, and making videos.

Although, I've always tried being more active and failed, so don't expect me to release anything. Either way, the process of creating and getting better is very fun. I like to do this stuff on my own terms. -->

## Contact me

I'm on a bunch of other sites, but you can reach me best via Mastodon, Discord, or e-mail.
