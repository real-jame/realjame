A game made by a friend and I to play on the 2010 version of Roblox, using Novetus, a launcher for old versions. It was submitted to and won a Novetus contest for Halloween-themed places!
Spooking Out is a party game about working together to catch ghosts in small maps. You can use the points you earn from rounds to buy tools that will help you out. The whole server must cooperate to catch them all quickly!
