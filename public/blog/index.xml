      <title>Update III - A Complete Redesign</title>

      <description>Hello, this time I don&amp;rsquo;t want to write about myself too much. Just the website. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent almost 2 weeks now working on this big redesign, I really hope you like it!&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s a sidebar instead of the old header. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a more effective use of desktop screen space, and on mobile, it turns into a horizontally scrolling top bar! I was inspired by Zenith&amp;rsquo;s website in terms of design.</description>

      <description>♫ Soul of Freedom - Uyama Hiroto + Cise Starr ♫ The trip was a few weeks ago. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write this blog post since the day I got home, but having time to reflect isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad thing.&#xA;Washington is great! I used to live here, and it&amp;rsquo;s still a very cool place. The colleges, too.&#xA;If you don&amp;rsquo;t care too much about lore you can skip to here for pretty pictures.</description>

      <description>♫ Airporter - Shing02 &amp;amp; Marcus D ♫ As I write this, in 6 hours, I&amp;rsquo;m heading to the airport and departing for Seattle, Washington.&#xA;I used to live in Washington, specifically a city nearby Seattle. My close family moved to Florida a few years ago, and I don&amp;rsquo;t feel at home here. Maybe, I&amp;hellip; move back?&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about it for a very long time. A trip to revisit the place would be a great start instead of jumping straight in with packing my bags and moving (Not like I can even do that without substantial effort and devotion).</description>

      <description>On Saturday, September 14, I went to the Space Coast Showdown, an off-season robotics competition with my team.&#xA;I say &amp;ldquo;my&amp;rdquo; team, but I am new to the club. It was worth it to take the whole day off to be there and support everyone. I also learned a lot for how I can help contribute in the feature, as well as what competitions are truly like!&#xA;{% include image.html url=&amp;quot;/blog/media/spacecoast-place_small.</description>
