  <p>Hello, this time I don&rsquo;t want to write about myself too much. Just the website. I&rsquo;ve spent almost 2 weeks now working on this big redesign, I really hope you like it!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/media/update-3-thumbnail.png" alt="Half of the old realja.me design and half of the new one side by side, fading into the bluish-white accent color to the bottom of the image. There are some dragonfly-looking arrows cut into the gradient."></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sidebar instead of the old header. I think it&rsquo;s a more effective use of desktop screen space, and on mobile, it turns into a horizontally scrolling top bar! I was inspired by <a href="https://zencorner.xyz">Zenith&rsquo;s website</a> in terms of design. The influence is definitely noticable in a lot of places :)</p>
<p>{% include image.html url=&quot;/blog/media/update-3-home.png&quot; alt=&ldquo;Home page before and after. The old one is a list of recent blog posts. The new home page has the sidebar along with a few paragraphs for a &lsquo;welcome&rsquo; section on the top of the home page, and then showing latest daily notes, blog posts, and devlogs.&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot more words on the front page now&rdquo; %}</p>
<p>The blog page was redesigned too. I worked to add more comprehensive options for RSS and tags. Now, you can subscribe to individual feeds. And with tags, there&rsquo;s tags for more specific topics, which don&rsquo;t take up as much space as the commonly used tags.</p>
<p>{% include image.html url=&quot;/blog/media/update-3-blog.png&quot; alt=&ldquo;Blog index before and after. The old one looks a lot more plain and empty, along with only fitting 1 blog post on the screen. The new blog index displays more on the screen, like multiple blog posts side-by-side, RSS feed options, and tags.&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Tag icons!&rdquo; %}</p>
<p>The <a href="/devlogs">Devlogs</a> page finally looks like a normal blog index, so that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>{% include image.html url=&quot;/blog/media/update-3-devlog.png&quot; alt=&ldquo;Devlogs index before and after. The new devlogs index shows thumbnails and is nicer formatted instead of just lists of texts and links like before.&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Hey, thumbnails!&rdquo; %}</p>
<p>The <a href="/note">Daily Notes</a> post feed is brand new, and is home to short-form writing. It&rsquo;s inspired by <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net">Simon Willison&rsquo;s TILs</a>. &ldquo;TILs&rdquo; (Today I Learned) will be the main type of post, but I hope to write more than that - personal thoughts, that kind of thing. We&rsquo;ll see. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Despite the name, I don&rsquo;t think I will ever actually post daily. Every other day, if I&rsquo;m lucky. I keep the name because it&rsquo;s kinda catchy and fits well regardless.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><img src="/blog/media/update-3-note.png" alt="The Daily Notes index page, featuring a brief explanation paragraph, tag filter and RSS options, and the list of recent notes."></p>
<p>It already has 2 posts that you can go read:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/note/ruby-debian.html">August 16, 2023: Installing the latest Ruby with rbenv on Debian</a></li>
<li><a href="/note/kindle-jailbreak.html">August 18, 2023: Jailbreaking a Kindle Voyage and installing KOReader</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="/projects">Projects page</a> is also new, listing my portfolio of works in a concise page. I spent a lot of time on its design, please give it a look!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/media/update-3-projects.png" alt="The projects page."></p>
<p>The <a href="/contact">About + Contact page</a> was remade from scratch, and it&rsquo;s <em>very</em> long now. It&rsquo;s not only about me, but it&rsquo;s about the site too. There are credits for the icons I used and shout-outs to people and sites that inspired mine! There&rsquo;s also a list of all my tech, if that&rsquo;s something you wanna see I guess.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/media/update-3-contact.png" alt="About + Contact page comparison. The old one is just a brief paragraph praising email and a few links to socials. The new one has a more descriptive section about me as a person (with profile picture) and more comprehensive links to socials."></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also more open about my personal self, mainly on the about page. I put up my Resume, and linked to my LinkedIn page which shows my real face and name! Losing anonymity on the internet is something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about, and generally, it&rsquo;s something I think I should do in order to help move towards profiting from my skills online. So there you go&hellip;</p>
<p>The tags system should be more robust and precise with the separate feeds. Tag filter pages now only show you posts from a certain feed, but give you the option to switch feeds or have all 3 feeds in the filter. This might be a bit overkill, but who&rsquo;s to say in a few years from now when this site has matured and there&rsquo;s, what, 100 posts? 200 notes?</p>
<p><img src="/blog/media/update-3-tag.png" alt="Tag page comparison. The new page has options to filter by feed and access other tags, and the posts now show thumbnails."></p>
<p>Last thing: a new button, enjoy. You should see other websites using it update automatically, like <a href="https://nick64.me">Nick64&rsquo;s site</a> :D</p>
<p>{% include image.html url=&quot;/assets/mybutton/2023-08-30-welcometoroblox.gif&quot; alt=&ldquo;An 88x31 gif of an old Roblox recording where a sign saying &lsquo;realjame&rsquo; gets blown into pieces in the middle of a small city, before the clip reverses and it comes back together.&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;This is the map used in John Shedletsky&rsquo;s 2008 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Welcome to ROBLOX<!-- raw HTML omitted --> trailer (or maybe a remake of it, I&rsquo;m not sure. You can find it in Novetus&rsquo;s default map pack).&rdquo; x=&ldquo;88&rdquo; y=&ldquo;31&rdquo; %}</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I&rsquo;m confident posting will be considerably more active. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of content this website will have. The daily notes especially would allow me to write whatever I want without worry of disrupting more long-form, important posts. Plus, announcements won&rsquo;t get buried by other posts thanks to it being archived in the Projects page. Finally, realja.me is organized and capable for everything I want to do with it.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/media/update-3-screenshot.jpg" alt="A screenshot of where the gif was recorded, in much higher resolution and captured at a different angle."></p>
<p>This is the 3rd time I made a status update after a few months of inactivity saying how I&rsquo;m healthier and I&rsquo;m back before being inactive again, but I dunno. This redesign has made me satisfied with the website. I don&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable looking at it, or guilty feeling that it&rsquo;s ugly, or neglected. I think every time I return in that way, I&rsquo;m not entirely there, but I improve a little bit, and so does my site. This might be the one to push me over. <strong>3rd time&rsquo;s the charm, right?</strong></p>
<p>WE ARE SO BACK :))))))</p>
