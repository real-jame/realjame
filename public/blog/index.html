    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-12-31-reflection-2023/">Reflecting on 2023</a></h2>
    Since 2023 is over in a few days, I want to recap what happened in 2023.
It is 10:44PM, and I am rushing this post out. So it won&rsquo;t be long, or edited. Expect a part 2 post tomorrow.
Stats I made 39 posts, wow!! 9 blog posts (including this one) 22 notes 8 devlogs Plus 4 blog post drafts and 8 note drafts I reached 123 followers on Mastodon (thank you, everyone!
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-08-30-update-3/">Update III - A Complete Redesign</a></h2>
    Hello, this time I don&rsquo;t want to write about myself too much. Just the website. I&rsquo;ve spent almost 2 weeks now working on this big redesign, I really hope you like it!
There&rsquo;s a sidebar instead of the old header. I think it&rsquo;s a more effective use of desktop screen space, and on mobile, it turns into a horizontally scrolling top bar! I was inspired by Zenith&rsquo;s website in terms of design.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-07-10-wa/">Seattle</a></h2>
    ♫ Soul of Freedom - Uyama Hiroto + Cise Starr ♫ The trip was a few weeks ago. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write this blog post since the day I got home, but having time to reflect isn&rsquo;t a bad thing.
Washington is great! I used to live here, and it&rsquo;s still a very cool place. The colleges, too.
If you don&rsquo;t care too much about lore you can skip to here for pretty pictures.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-06-18-tn/">Tennessee and journaling to process what is beyond</a></h2>
    ♫ Airporter - Shing02 &amp; Marcus D ♫ As I write this, in 6 hours, I&rsquo;m heading to the airport and departing for Seattle, Washington.
I used to live in Washington, specifically a city nearby Seattle. My close family moved to Florida a few years ago, and I don&rsquo;t feel at home here. Maybe, I&hellip; move back?
I&rsquo;ve thought about it for a very long time. A trip to revisit the place would be a great start instead of jumping straight in with packing my bags and moving (Not like I can even do that without substantial effort and devotion).

    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-10-15-space-coast/">Robotics competition and solar eclipse and stuff</a></h2>
    On Saturday, September 14, I went to the Space Coast Showdown, an off-season robotics competition with my team.
I say &ldquo;my&rdquo; team, but I am new to the club. It was worth it to take the whole day off to be there and support everyone. I also learned a lot for how I can help contribute in the feature, as well as what competitions are truly like!

    <h2><a href="/blog/2024-03-13-simple-layout/">Simple layout, why not?</a></h2>
    I made an alternate, minimal version of my website. You can find it on the sidebar, or head to simple.realja.me.
{% include image.html url=&quot;/blog/media/simple-home_small.png&quot; alt=&ldquo;Screenshot of the simple layout&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Rendered in Opera 8, a browser from 2005&rdquo; %}
Now, you can read my website on practically any web browser and device ever made!
