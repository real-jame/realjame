<p>As I write this, in 6 hours, I&rsquo;m heading to the airport and departing for Seattle, Washington.</p>
<p>I used to live in Washington, specifically a city nearby Seattle. My close family moved to Florida a few years ago, and I don&rsquo;t feel at home here. Maybe, I&hellip; move back?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about it for a very long time. A trip to revisit the place would be a great start instead of jumping straight in with packing my bags and moving (Not like I can even do that without substantial effort and devotion). Now that a trip is on my doorstep, it&rsquo;s hard to describe how to feel. It&rsquo;s hard <em>to feel</em>, for an odd reason.</p>
<p>I went with my family to Tennessee to meet a relative new to my life. This state is beautiful!</p>
<p>After living in Florida for the last few years, I missed hills. TN has hills galore!</p>
<p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t really know what travel blogs write about, so I will instead use this blog post as a journal to overcome feelings and plan my goals for the upcoming trip.</p>
<p>Enjoy the pictures, though. PSA: Open images individually to see their full, uncropped size :)</p>
<h2 id="pictures-and-journaling">Pictures and journaling</h2>
<p><img src="/blog/media/PXL_20230526_181008662.MP.jpg" alt="Photo of a balcony-side view of the Great Smoky Mountains, with a nearby cabin, endless trees, and mountains."></p>
<p>Although, I didn&rsquo;t do much exploring. The Airbnb we stayed at was wonderful, and the goal wasn&rsquo;t necessarily about Tennessee, but about family.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/media/PXL_20230526_014914879.MP.jpg" alt="Photo of a green luna moth resting on the side of a lamp outside at night"></p>
<p>As the Washington trip approaches, I need to have a different approach to this trip than any other I&rsquo;ve been on.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/media/PXL_20230526_190201896.MP.jpg" alt="Photo of a half-eaten pizza along with numerous other items on a restaurant table, including salt and pepper shakers, plates, and water bottles."></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to not only tour colleges for next year, but the state as a whole. Do I really still want to live here? Or is it just some sort of nostalgia of childhood life affecting my views?</p>
<p><img src="/blog/media/PXL_20230526_192647714.MP.jpg" alt="Photo of a small shop, selling countless items such as stuffed bears, coffee, spices, and more that&rsquo;s hard to see in the back of the room."></p>
<p>To that end, I want to use the time I have to my fullest. 4 days, so 2 full days to experience Seattle. I think I&rsquo;ll spend a day to hang out with old friends in my old city, too.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/media/PXL_20230526_204124058.MP.jpg" alt="Photo of an indoor snow tubing attraction."></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sleep in for this trip, and I don&rsquo;t want to spend most of my time relaxing in our accomodation.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/media/PXL_20230526_211752137.jpg" alt="Photo of nature; trees, dirt, bushes, weeds, and other greenery."></p>
<p>What will I do with this extra time? I&rsquo;m not sure. You know what sounds nice? Waking up early, walking out of the room to a nearby coffee shop and grabbing a drink in the cold Seattle morning&hellip; Seattle is infamous for having a Starbucks on basically every block. Local places, of course, are great too.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/media/PXL_20230526_221134356.MP.jpg" alt="Photo of a high school football game, taken from the sidelines."></p>
<p>Speaking of cold, I miss that too. Florida is too hot and humid for my liking.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/media/PXL_20230527_172930679.MP.jpg" alt="Photo of a strange, small object in the middle of a triangle formed by red caution tape saying &ldquo;CAUTION: ELECTRIC LINE BURIED BELOW&rdquo;. The object appears to be a board with two plates on the top of its front side, with marker drawn to make it look like eyes, as well as a smile drawn below the plates."></p>
<p>There is a lot I miss about Washington. Will it live up to my expectations? I don&rsquo;t want to have too many.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/media/PXL_20230528_001236975.MP.jpg" alt="Photo of a cloudy day at a parking lot surrounded by electric lines and tall hills coated in greenery."></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to the trip above all. Washington may not be how I remember it, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>In the past, I could have done so much more, and so much better. I&rsquo;m nowhere near the best person I can be. At least I&rsquo;m improving now, and fighting for a better future as much as I can. So, the one thing I hope to get from this trip is determining what I will be spending my final year of high school working towards.</p>
<p>Good pictures would also be nice to get too.</p>
