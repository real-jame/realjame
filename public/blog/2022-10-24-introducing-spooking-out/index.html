<p>Hello! I&rsquo;m proud to announce a brand new game made for the classic Roblox engine (2010 specifically), made in collaboration with my friend, Tobu.fi.</p>
<p>Come play the game with us on a 24/7 server I&rsquo;m hosting for the game, or <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1033943226727542887/1033943288463511692/Spooking_Out.rbxl">download a copy of the game for yourself</a>.</p>

<p><strong>12/4/22 edit: the server went down after Halloween. It was a ton of fun playing with everyone! Thank you so much for your feedback and appreciation for what we made : ]</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
<p><em>Spooking Out!</em> is a round based co-op game about catching ghosts. When the round starts, explore the map to find ghosts and use the Skullshot tool to sling skulls at ghosts.</p>
<p>After you deplete the ghost&rsquo;s health, switch to the Grab tool and click on it. You&rsquo;ll pick it up, now walk to the big hole and click again to throw it in! You can hold down the letting-go click to charge up your shot and throw it a farther distance.</p>
<p>Work together with everyone in the server to capture all the ghosts before time runs out. In the lobby, spend your hard-earned tickets in the shop to buy secondary items.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, secondary items! You can choose a 2nd item to equip alongside your Skullshot. This tool or ability can help you and your team out, so try all of them to find your favorite!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-novetus">What is Novetus?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in playing, you can install Novetus <a href="https://bitl.itch.io/novetus">here</a>! Novetus is a free and open-source launcher for old Roblox clients that allows you to host servers, edit maps in Studio, and play solo or online.</p>
<p>In order to join our server, make sure you download the current &ldquo;Stable&rdquo; release, not &ldquo;Unstable Beta/Snapshot/Pre-Release&rdquo;. (It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you choose &ldquo;Full&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lite&rdquo;, lite simply isn&rsquo;t bundled with any classic maps.) Unzip it and launch &ldquo;NovetusBootstrapper.exe&rdquo;. In the launcher, set the IP, port, and client version to the ones specified in the server info, and you&rsquo;ll be able to join!</p>
<p>Novetus is Windows-exclusive, but it works well in Wine if you&rsquo;re on Linux. And if you&rsquo;re running into issues opening Novetus or 2010L, make sure you install the required dependencies (found in the &ldquo;_redist&rdquo; or using the &ldquo;Dependency Installer&rdquo; tool in Novetus):</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables 2008
<ul>
<li>Required to run clients from 2008 and above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0
<ul>
<li>Required for the Novetus launcher to run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>.NET 4.0 Update (KB2468871)
<ul>
<li>Required to run the Novetus launcher on Windows XP and Vista machines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on Linux, you don&rsquo;t need to install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0. When running Novetus for the first time, Wine will prompt you to install Mono if you haven&rsquo;t already, so install that instead.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, this is unrelated to our game but if you are trying out Novetus and would like to play the 2007 or 2011+ clients, check the Dependency Installer to see what special dependencies you need to install to run them.</p>
<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>This game started because Tobu.fi wanted to submit a game to a Halloween game contest in the <a href="https://discord.gg/Jfrdmx3ZwQ">Novetus Discord server</a>. The best game will be included in the launcher&rsquo;s pre-installed map collection.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been working on a game for about a month before that point, so our plan was to make it Halloween-themed. Brand new maps and a lobby, as well as a new challenge for the rounds - instead of simply picking up boxes, you have to first kill ghosts with a separate tool, while they&rsquo;re moving around. Development was pretty smooth because we were able to reuse the existing code for rounds, the shop, the Grab tool, and some shop items - with a few modifications.</p>
<p>Tobu.fi first created the original prototype of the game, he created the ghosts. I took that prototype and merged it with the base game to create a fork of it. I reworked the scripts to accomodate what&rsquo;s changed.</p>
<p>Unlike the base game, where we wish to only include 2 or 3 maps and have the community build more maps, this game was on a lot shorter deadline, so I made just 1 map and the lobby, and the other maps are reused from classic Roblox games.</p>
<p>We submitted it to the Novetus contest on October 22, and we got nearly a dozen players on the server. You can see them in the player list of the screenshots I provided, and it was a joy to finally share our work with the public!</p>
<p>In fact, one of the players, <a href="https://lachrymogenic.gitlab.io">Lachrymogenic</a>, created a thumbnail for our game, which we&rsquo;ve adopted as the logo and branding. Thank you so much!!!</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p><em>Spooking Out!</em> as well as the existing work from the original game took a lot of effort from both of us in all parts of development. We hope you enjoy playing it just as much we did making it!</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the start, you can currently play it on Novetus. But what if you don&rsquo;t have a computer or simply don&rsquo;t wish to install Novetus? Well, we plan to <strong>port the game to modern Roblox</strong>, and it&rsquo;s being worked on right now! When it&rsquo;s done, I&rsquo;ll write another article to introduce the modern port and it&rsquo;s behind-the-scenes when it releases.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
