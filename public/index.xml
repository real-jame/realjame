      <description>Sometimes I have a fragment of a thought about something. Like my mind has a point to make, or I just have the idea for something slightly poetical or writing-y.&#xA;And I would just let it go, because&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know, actually. Probably I didn&amp;rsquo;t care enough to write it down when I got the opportunity too.&#xA;I decided yesterday to just start writing these down. I already journal a little bit, but I feel like writing down these thoughts is something important I should do.</description>

      <description>I am frustrated about being frustrated about this many things.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m frustrated about how many days I&amp;rsquo;ve spent feeling frustrated. I could have spent that time talking with my good friend, or taking a walk through neighborhood, or creating pieces of stunning, incredible art.&#xA;While thinking of all the reasons that make me frustrated, I started to get frustrated&amp;hellip; funny how that stuff works out.&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jadp64OvrZk</description>

      <description>Since 2023 is over in a few days, I want to recap what happened in 2023.&#xA;It is 10:44PM, and I am rushing this post out. So it won&amp;rsquo;t be long, or edited. Expect a part 2 post tomorrow.&#xA;Stats I made 39 posts, wow!! 9 blog posts (including this one) 22 notes 8 devlogs Plus 4 blog post drafts and 8 note drafts I reached 123 followers on Mastodon (thank you, everyone!</description>

      <description>Hey, check out Livakivi on YouTube.&#xA;He makes videos about a few topics, such as learning Japanese, learning art, working out, etc. But at their core, he makes videos about self-improvement and working to be better, to expand your mind and body every day.&#xA;I was very, very inactive not only on the blog, but on all projects and skills I&amp;rsquo;m learning in November and part of December. What helped me get back into the swing of things and with better disclipine was his videos.</description>

      <description>For the holidays, I added a simple snowing effect.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s not actually my code, but I did make a simple control to toggle the snow effect.&#xA;Adding the snowing effect I was playing around with the classic snowstorm.js script by Scott Schiller, but I could never get it to properly turn on and off without requiring a page reload when making button. Plus, it always looked super distracting no matter what I did.</description>

      <description>I said I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting back into reading books. Now I&amp;rsquo;m on Bookwyrm, so you can keep up with what I&amp;rsquo;m reading, because I keep being lazy about writing posts for them. üôè&#xA;If you want to follow me:&#xA;@jame@bookwyrm.social RSS feed if you&amp;rsquo;re outside of the whole newfangled Fediverse thingy What is Bookwyrm? Bookwyrm is a social network for books (like Goodreads). So you can catalogue all your books on the website, give reviews and status updates, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a bit every day this month, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be blogging each week about the books.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll say more in the first week&amp;rsquo;s article, but I try to find books I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of and seem interesting when I&amp;rsquo;m at the library.&#xA;In other words, I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to read all of these books, but explore them. Even if you give up on a book, or simply skim it, you still gain something, I think.</description>

      <description>Buy an expensive companion for your phone, and that&amp;rsquo;ll lead you to use your phone less? It sounds like an oxymoron. But after over a month of using my Google Pixel Watch, it seems to be true!&#xA;So, yeah. I&amp;rsquo;ve been dealing with spending more time on my phone than I&amp;rsquo;d like. And I try stuff like time tracking apps, blocking, etc. but nothing works. Quite simply, if my phone was there, I would be on it, such as before going to bed and then immediately waking up.</description>

      <description>For the last few years, there&amp;rsquo;s been low-stakes movements to rediscover the aesthetics and values that composed of the Web 1.0 era internet - that is, from the 90s to the early/mid 2000s.&#xA;{% include image.html url=&amp;quot;/note/media/glorification-neocities.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;ldquo;Index page for websites people have made on Neocities&amp;rdquo; caption=&amp;ldquo;Neocities is a modern-day platform for website creation and hosting, which people commonly use for their personal, sometimes Web 1.0 themed, websites.&amp;rdquo; %}&#xA;I find it fun, why do you think this site is here in the first place?</description>

      <description>That‚Äôs the promise: you will live more curiously if you write. You will become a scientist, if not of the natural world than of whatever world you care about. More of that world will pop alive. You will see more when you look at it.&#xA;Read it: https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write&#xA;Fantastic, inspiring post. I&amp;rsquo;ve kept journals the whole year because of this, and I won&amp;rsquo;t stop.&#xA;Writing, being able to format and output thoughts in your mind, is one of the most effective tools for better valuing and reflecting on each day that goes by.</description>

      <description>I wanted to write another daily note. (I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to.)&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m not dead. That&amp;rsquo;s the most important thing! Now you know.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to show for any projects at the moment. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything or I&amp;rsquo;ve abandoned them; just that they aren&amp;rsquo;t complete enough to present.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s the reason there haven&amp;rsquo;t been any blog/devlog posts. For the near future, I only want to share completed work and not just discuss what I&amp;rsquo;m dreaming of.</description>

      <description>November is upon us! Did you have a good Halloween? And are you aware that Spooking Out, the 2010 Roblox game by me and a friend, is now a year old (give or take a few days)?&#xA;We have no idea if it&amp;rsquo;s been hosted and played by other people independently in this time. But a few weeks ago, my friend hosted a server for it, and people still like the game!</description>

      <title>Thoughts on corru.observer (it&#39;s very cool)</title>

      <description>corru.observer is a very strange website. It&amp;rsquo;s an interactive story that&amp;rsquo;s part 3D game, part visual novel, part website. Hypertext fiction at its finest.&#xA;When I stumbled across it, I basically spent the rest of my night playing it for 3 hours straight. It&amp;rsquo;s right up my wheelhouse, and great stuff!! I really do not want to say anything about what corru.observer is about. If you think you are interested, stop reading and play it now.</description>

      <description>Setting up a remote control / web UI for my 3D printer was a game changer, I regret doing this sooner. Give OctoPrint a try!&#xA;Do you think 3D printing is cool? My dad bought a 3D printer for the both of us last year, but it went mostly unused due to some issues with calibration and also just, kinda getting lazy.&#xA;But I set everything up again, and somehow, after doing nothing but collect dust for 4 months, it prints better than when I was actively calibrating.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on textarea.site as a way to dive back into the beautiful and the ugly parts of front-end web development. After a few days of work, I decided to rewrite the entire project in Svelte. Surprising? Maybe not. It&amp;rsquo;s about the right tool for the job, and here, React is not it.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m sure people have written countless times about this. But it&amp;rsquo;s true that being versatile is one of the best skills you can have as a software developer.</description>

      <description>Day 3 of September. Things are going OK for me, I just wanted to write down here what I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for this month. Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m focusing on college applications and web development projects, so Roblox stuff will keep taking a back seat.&#xA;I wrote on my Projects page that the new Project Micrathena will resume development this month. I hope I will find time to work on it, but it will likely be at the end of September, and not the start as hoped.</description>

      <description>Hello, this time I don&amp;rsquo;t want to write about myself too much. Just the website. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent almost 2 weeks now working on this big redesign, I really hope you like it!&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s a sidebar instead of the old header. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a more effective use of desktop screen space, and on mobile, it turns into a horizontally scrolling top bar! I was inspired by Zenith&amp;rsquo;s website in terms of design.</description>

      <description>I love my 2014 Kindle Voyage, actively been using it for almost 10 years now. But after finding out update support ended a while ago, why not finally jailbreak it and install more open and featureful e-reader software?&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m new to KOReader, so I&amp;rsquo;ll have to see if I actually like using it as a daily driver. But it can&amp;rsquo;t hurt to try, and at the very least, liberating the device might come in handy in the future.</description>

      <title>Installing the latest Ruby with rbenv on Debian</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/notes/2023-08-16-ruby-debian/</link>

      <description>I decided to switch from running Ruby natively on Windows to WSL, because Ruby on Windows is pretty bad. Installing the rbenv tool to manage multiple versions of Ruby is simple, but in order to add (by compiling) a Ruby version, there are a few dependencies to install.&#xA;For context, rbenv is a version manager tool for Ruby. This allows me to have multiple versions of Ruby installed at once and switch between at any time.</description>

      <description>I was testing this with Opera 8.

Is it really that easy to click to ten?&#xA;I had to find out. And the game was free, too.&#xA;Look at the trailer, this game has to be good!&#xA;I installed it, and the worry set in as I slowly clicked.</description>

      <description>I thought to write something about this because someone on Mastodon noted it in a post: the nights in Florida are growing cold. He wrote a thread that I&amp;rsquo;d like to share, about a change in pace for the place I live.&#xA;RüéÉB üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà RMiddleton.art (@RMiddleton@mastodon.art) Sep 29:&#xA;In wonderful news my window is open and air that‚Äôs around 20C / 69F is breezing its way in. That makes me very happy.</description>

      <description>I wish you well.&#xA;Moving to the next quarter of this year, April to the end of June.&#xA;So much inactivity, struggle, I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip;&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s beginning to set in how much nothing has happened in 2024 so far. I cannot remember anything of value really occuring these last few months despite a general feeling of &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting better at life I guess&amp;rdquo; and even then?&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m leaving for college this year, but will things change even then?</description>

      <title>I need to blog more</title>

      <description>I have a lot of ideas for daily notes while my blog is collecting dust. Why? I think it comes down to being too lazy for the detail I want to put into blog posts - which ends up leaving my blog not having any blog posts. I really just need to lower my standards and write.&#xA;I made this notes section to encourage faster writing, but it makes me question how exact the separation is.</description>

      <description>On Saturday, September 14, I went to the Space Coast Showdown, an off-season robotics competition with my team.&#xA;I say &amp;ldquo;my&amp;rdquo; team, but I am new to the club. It was worth it to take the whole day off to be there and support everyone. I also learned a lot for how I can help contribute in the feature, as well as what competitions are truly like!&#xA;{% include image.html url=&amp;quot;/blog/media/spacecoast-place_small.</description>

      <title>Simple layout, why not?</title>

      <description>I made an alternate, minimal version of my website. You can find it on the sidebar, or head to simple.realja.me.&#xA;{% include image.html url=&amp;quot;/blog/media/simple-home_small.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;ldquo;Screenshot of the simple layout&amp;rdquo; caption=&amp;ldquo;Rendered in Opera 8, a browser from 2005&amp;rdquo; %}&#xA;Now, you can read my website on practically any web browser and device ever made!&#xA;{% include image.html url=&amp;quot;/blog/media/simple-nav_small.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;ldquo;The navigation menu displayed on a red Nintendo DSi&amp;rdquo; caption=&amp;ldquo;Running on a Nintendo DSi!</description>

      <title>Thinking about the simple layout</title>

      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s kinda funny that I am motivated to make this alternate version, but not to actually write posts.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s what I was thinking while making it: ok, I can access this site from anywhere. But what is there to read?&#xA;I feel like this is a common occurence with a lot of blogs out there, especially ones by web developers: most likely only a few posts, and the majority of them are simply explaining how the site was implemented, in whatever static site generator or CSS styling they picked.</description>

      <title>Where are the daily notes?</title>

      <description>Short answer: I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending my time working on Micrathena!&#xA;I still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten into a good schedule of finding time to write blog posts. These past few weeks, the time I devote to working on projects has been spent almost completely on Micrathena. (Or, just slacking off from it). So that&amp;rsquo;s why there&amp;rsquo;s been a lack of &amp;ldquo;thought&amp;rdquo; (non-nerd) daily notes.&#xA;But what about tech related daily notes? &amp;ldquo;Today I Learned&amp;rdquo; posts, right?</description>

      <title>Writing without smarts</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not (currently) a full-on writer in my eyes, but I still write a lot of blog posts, and essays in school. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed I use writing apps that come without any &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; features like spell check, auto correct, etc. But is it really a good thing to have?&#xA;I just write blog posts in my code editor, Visual Studio Code. It does the job, and writing Markdown anywhere else might cause issues because of which features are supported by which editors.</description>
