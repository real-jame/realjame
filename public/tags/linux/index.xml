      <description>Setting up a remote control / web UI for my 3D printer was a game changer, I regret doing this sooner. Give OctoPrint a try!&#xA;Do you think 3D printing is cool? My dad bought a 3D printer for the both of us last year, but it went mostly unused due to some issues with calibration and also just, kinda getting lazy.&#xA;But I set everything up again, and somehow, after doing nothing but collect dust for 4 months, it prints better than when I was actively calibrating.</description>

      <title>Installing the latest Ruby with rbenv on Debian</title>

      <description>I decided to switch from running Ruby natively on Windows to WSL, because Ruby on Windows is pretty bad. Installing the rbenv tool to manage multiple versions of Ruby is simple, but in order to add (by compiling) a Ruby version, there are a few dependencies to install.&#xA;For context, rbenv is a version manager tool for Ruby. This allows me to have multiple versions of Ruby installed at once and switch between at any time.</description>
