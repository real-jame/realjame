      <description>I am frustrated about being frustrated about this many things.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m frustrated about how many days I&amp;rsquo;ve spent feeling frustrated. I could have spent that time talking with my good friend, or taking a walk through neighborhood, or creating pieces of stunning, incredible art.&#xA;While thinking of all the reasons that make me frustrated, I started to get frustrated&amp;hellip; funny how that stuff works out.&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jadp64OvrZk</description>

      <description>Hey, check out Livakivi on YouTube.&#xA;He makes videos about a few topics, such as learning Japanese, learning art, working out, etc. But at their core, he makes videos about self-improvement and working to be better, to expand your mind and body every day.&#xA;I was very, very inactive not only on the blog, but on all projects and skills I&amp;rsquo;m learning in November and part of December. What helped me get back into the swing of things and with better disclipine was his videos.</description>

      <description>That‚Äôs the promise: you will live more curiously if you write. You will become a scientist, if not of the natural world than of whatever world you care about. More of that world will pop alive. You will see more when you look at it.&#xA;Read it: https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write&#xA;Fantastic, inspiring post. I&amp;rsquo;ve kept journals the whole year because of this, and I won&amp;rsquo;t stop.&#xA;Writing, being able to format and output thoughts in your mind, is one of the most effective tools for better valuing and reflecting on each day that goes by.</description>
