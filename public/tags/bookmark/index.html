    <h2><a href="/notes/2024-02-26-cheesyhfj/">🔗🎞️ Cheesy Hfj: &#39;i am frustrated&#39;</a></h2>
    I am frustrated about being frustrated about this many things.
I&rsquo;m frustrated about how many days I&rsquo;ve spent feeling frustrated. I could have spent that time talking with my good friend, or taking a walk through neighborhood, or creating pieces of stunning, incredible art.
While thinking of all the reasons that make me frustrated, I started to get frustrated&hellip; funny how that stuff works out.

    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-12-28-livakivi/">🔗 Livakivi, a cool and motivating YouTube channel</a></h2>
    Hey, check out Livakivi on YouTube.
He makes videos about a few topics, such as learning Japanese, learning art, working out, etc. But at their core, he makes videos about self-improvement and working to be better, to expand your mind and body every day.
I was very, very inactive not only on the blog, but on all projects and skills I&rsquo;m learning in November and part of December. What helped me get back into the swing of things and with better disclipine was his videos.

    That’s the promise: you will live more curiously if you write. You will become a scientist, if not of the natural world than of whatever world you care about. More of that world will pop alive. You will see more when you look at it.

Fantastic, inspiring post. I&rsquo;ve kept journals the whole year because of this, and I won&rsquo;t stop.
Writing, being able to format and output thoughts in your mind, is one of the most effective tools for better valuing and reflecting on each day that goes by.
