    November is upon us! Did you have a good Halloween? And are you aware that Spooking Out, the 2010 Roblox game by me and a friend, is now a year old (give or take a few days)?
We have no idea if it&rsquo;s been hosted and played by other people independently in this time. But a few weeks ago, my friend hosted a server for it, and people still like the game!
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2022-11-02-spooking-out-modern-roblox-port/">Spooking Out&#39;s Modern Roblox Port</a></h2>
    Hey everyone, I am proud to announce the modern Roblox port of Spooking Out! has been published to the Roblox website!
Don&rsquo;t know about Spooking Out? Read the [previous article]({% post_url /blog/2022-10-24-introducing-spooking-out %}).
This means you can now play our game on modern Roblox. Oh, and we also went back and improved the experience to make playing it on mobile, controller, and Xbox just as playable and fun!
Play it here!
