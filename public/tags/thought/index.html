  <h1>Thought</h1>
  
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2024-04-04-drafts/">Saving drafts</a></h2>
    Sometimes I have a fragment of a thought about something. Like my mind has a point to make, or I just have the idea for something slightly poetical or writing-y.
And I would just let it go, because&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, actually. Probably I didn&rsquo;t care enough to write it down when I got the opportunity too.
I decided yesterday to just start writing these down. I already journal a little bit, but I feel like writing down these thoughts is something important I should do.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-12-31-reflection-2023/">Reflecting on 2023</a></h2>
    Since 2023 is over in a few days, I want to recap what happened in 2023.
It is 10:44PM, and I am rushing this post out. So it won&rsquo;t be long, or edited. Expect a part 2 post tomorrow.
Stats I made 39 posts, wow!! 9 blog posts (including this one) 22 notes 8 devlogs Plus 4 blog post drafts and 8 note drafts I reached 123 followers on Mastodon (thank you, everyone!
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-12-26-bookwyrm/">I&#39;m joining Bookwyrm üìñ</a></h2>
    I said I&rsquo;ve been getting back into reading books. Now I&rsquo;m on Bookwyrm, so you can keep up with what I&rsquo;m reading, because I keep being lazy about writing posts for them. üôè
If you want to follow me:
@jame@bookwyrm.social RSS feed if you&rsquo;re outside of the whole newfangled Fediverse thingy What is Bookwyrm? Bookwyrm is a social network for books (like Goodreads). So you can catalogue all your books on the website, give reviews and status updates, it&rsquo;s pretty cool!
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-12-25-christmas/">Christmas</a></h2>
    Hope it was a good one. I know mine was. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Here&rsquo;s my gift to readers, and to myself: I will write a new post every day until New Years. So stay tuned!
That&rsquo;s all for now,

    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-12-08-december-reading/">Reading this month</a></h2>
    I&rsquo;ve been reading a bit every day this month, so I&rsquo;ll be blogging each week about the books.
I&rsquo;ll say more in the first week&rsquo;s article, but I try to find books I&rsquo;ve never heard of and seem interesting when I&rsquo;m at the library.
In other words, I&rsquo;m not trying to read all of these books, but explore them. Even if you give up on a book, or simply skim it, you still gain something, I think.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-11-25-smartwatch/">Wanna cut down on phone usage? Try a smartwatch!</a></h2>
    Buy an expensive companion for your phone, and that&rsquo;ll lead you to use your phone less? It sounds like an oxymoron. But after over a month of using my Google Pixel Watch, it seems to be true!
So, yeah. I&rsquo;ve been dealing with spending more time on my phone than I&rsquo;d like. And I try stuff like time tracking apps, blocking, etc. but nothing works. Quite simply, if my phone was there, I would be on it, such as before going to bed and then immediately waking up.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-11-21-glorification/">Will people glorify the current internet in 20 years?</a></h2>
    For the last few years, there&rsquo;s been low-stakes movements to rediscover the aesthetics and values that composed of the Web 1.0 era internet - that is, from the 90s to the early/mid 2000s.
{% include image.html url=&quot;/note/media/glorification-neocities.jpg&quot; alt=&ldquo;Index page for websites people have made on Neocities&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Neocities is a modern-day platform for website creation and hosting, which people commonly use for their personal, sometimes Web 1.0 themed, websites.&rdquo; %}
I find it fun, why do you think this site is here in the first place?
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-09-25-corru-observer/">Thoughts on corru.observer (it&#39;s very cool)</a></h2>
    corru.observer is a very strange website. It&rsquo;s an interactive story that&rsquo;s part 3D game, part visual novel, part website. Hypertext fiction at its finest.
When I stumbled across it, I basically spent the rest of my night playing it for 3 hours straight. It&rsquo;s right up my wheelhouse, and great stuff!! I really do not want to say anything about what corru.observer is about. If you think you are interested, stop reading and play it now.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-09-03-september-status/">September Status</a></h2>
    Day 3 of September. Things are going OK for me, I just wanted to write down here what I&rsquo;m aiming for this month. Right now, I&rsquo;m focusing on college applications and web development projects, so Roblox stuff will keep taking a back seat.
I wrote on my Projects page that the new Project Micrathena will resume development this month. I hope I will find time to work on it, but it will likely be at the end of September, and not the start as hoped.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-08-30-update-3/">Update III - A Complete Redesign</a></h2>
    Hello, this time I don&rsquo;t want to write about myself too much. Just the website. I&rsquo;ve spent almost 2 weeks now working on this big redesign, I really hope you like it!
There&rsquo;s a sidebar instead of the old header. I think it&rsquo;s a more effective use of desktop screen space, and on mobile, it turns into a horizontally scrolling top bar! I was inspired by Zenith&rsquo;s website in terms of design.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-07-10-wa/">Seattle</a></h2>
    ‚ô´ Soul of Freedom - Uyama Hiroto + Cise Starr ‚ô´ The trip was a few weeks ago. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write this blog post since the day I got home, but having time to reflect isn&rsquo;t a bad thing.
Washington is great! I used to live here, and it&rsquo;s still a very cool place. The colleges, too.
If you don&rsquo;t care too much about lore you can skip to here for pretty pictures.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-06-18-tn/">Tennessee and journaling to process what is beyond</a></h2>
    ‚ô´ Airporter - Shing02 &amp; Marcus D ‚ô´ As I write this, in 6 hours, I&rsquo;m heading to the airport and departing for Seattle, Washington.
I used to live in Washington, specifically a city nearby Seattle. My close family moved to Florida a few years ago, and I don&rsquo;t feel at home here. Maybe, I&hellip; move back?
I&rsquo;ve thought about it for a very long time. A trip to revisit the place would be a great start instead of jumping straight in with packing my bags and moving (Not like I can even do that without substantial effort and devotion).
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2022-11-02-spooking-out-modern-roblox-port/">Spooking Out&#39;s Modern Roblox Port</a></h2>
    Hey everyone, I am proud to announce the modern Roblox port of Spooking Out! has been published to the Roblox website!

    <h2><a href="/blog/2022-10-24-introducing-spooking-out/">Introducing Spooking Out!</a></h2>
    Hello! I&rsquo;m proud to announce a brand new game made for the classic Roblox engine (2010 specifically), made in collaboration with my friend, Tobu.fi.
Come play the game with us on a 24/7 server I&rsquo;m hosting for the game, or download a copy of the game for yourself.
Client: 2010L IP: court-michelle.at.playit.gg Port: 41927 Map: Spooking Out! Players: 12 Version: Novetus 1.3 v8.2022.1 Not sure how long I will keep this server running&hellip; at least until Halloween.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-10-03-click-to-ten/">CLICK TO TEN</a></h2>
    Can you do it? Click to Ten is a game I found on my friend&rsquo;s Steam profile - he only had 1 minute of playtime, yet he told me he beat it! How can that be? Is it really that easy to click to ten?
I had to find out. And the game was free, too.
Look at the trailer, this game has to be good!
I installed it, and the worry set in as I slowly clicked.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-10-11-cold-nights/">Cold nights in Florida</a></h2>
    I thought to write something about this because someone on Mastodon noted it in a post: the nights in Florida are growing cold. He wrote a thread that I&rsquo;d like to share, about a change in pace for the place I live.
RüéÉB üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà RMiddleton.art (@RMiddleton@mastodon.art) Sep 29:
In wonderful news my window is open and air that‚Äôs around 20C / 69F is breezing its way in. That makes me very happy.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2024-03-31-goodnight/">Good night</a></h2>
    I wish you well.
Moving to the next quarter of this year, April to the end of June.
So much inactivity, struggle, I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;
It&rsquo;s beginning to set in how much nothing has happened in 2024 so far. I cannot remember anything of value really occuring these last few months despite a general feeling of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been getting better at life I guess&rdquo; and even then?
I&rsquo;m leaving for college this year, but will things change even then?
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-09-28-blog-more/">I need to blog more</a></h2>
    I have a lot of ideas for daily notes while my blog is collecting dust. Why? I think it comes down to being too lazy for the detail I want to put into blog posts - which ends up leaving my blog not having any blog posts. I really just need to lower my standards and write.
I made this notes section to encourage faster writing, but it makes me question how exact the separation is.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-10-15-space-coast/">Robotics competition and solar eclipse and stuff</a></h2>
    On Saturday, September 14, I went to the Space Coast Showdown, an off-season robotics competition with my team.
I say &ldquo;my&rdquo; team, but I am new to the club. It was worth it to take the whole day off to be there and support everyone. I also learned a lot for how I can help contribute in the feature, as well as what competitions are truly like!
{% include image.html url=&quot;/blog/media/spacecoast-place_small.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2024-03-14-simple-layout-thoughts/">Thinking about the simple layout</a></h2>
    I think it&rsquo;s kinda funny that I am motivated to make this alternate version, but not to actually write posts.
That&rsquo;s what I was thinking while making it: ok, I can access this site from anywhere. But what is there to read?
I feel like this is a common occurence with a lot of blogs out there, especially ones by web developers: most likely only a few posts, and the majority of them are simply explaining how the site was implemented, in whatever static site generator or CSS styling they picked.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-10-01-where-are-the-notes/">Where are the daily notes?</a></h2>
    Short answer: I&rsquo;ve been spending my time working on Micrathena!
I still haven&rsquo;t gotten into a good schedule of finding time to write blog posts. These past few weeks, the time I devote to working on projects has been spent almost completely on Micrathena. (Or, just slacking off from it). So that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s been a lack of &ldquo;thought&rdquo; (non-nerd) daily notes.
But what about tech related daily notes? &ldquo;Today I Learned&rdquo; posts, right?
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-10-07-writing-smarts/">Writing without smarts</a></h2>
    I&rsquo;m not (currently) a full-on writer in my eyes, but I still write a lot of blog posts, and essays in school. I&rsquo;ve noticed I use writing apps that come without any &ldquo;smart&rdquo; features like spell check, auto correct, etc. But is it really a good thing to have?
I just write blog posts in my code editor, Visual Studio Code. It does the job, and writing Markdown anywhere else might cause issues because of which features are supported by which editors.
