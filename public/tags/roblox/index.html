    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-11-08-hi/">hi</a></h2>
    I wanted to write another daily note. (I&rsquo;ve been meaning to.)
I&rsquo;m not dead. That&rsquo;s the most important thing! Now you know.
I don&rsquo;t have anything to show for any projects at the moment. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I haven&rsquo;t done anything or I&rsquo;ve abandoned them; just that they aren&rsquo;t complete enough to present.
That&rsquo;s the reason there haven&rsquo;t been any blog/devlog posts. For the near future, I only want to share completed work and not just discuss what I&rsquo;m dreaming of.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-11-1-spooking-out-1-year/">Spooking Out 1 year anniversary!</a></h2>
    November is upon us! Did you have a good Halloween? And are you aware that Spooking Out, the 2010 Roblox game by me and a friend, is now a year old (give or take a few days)?
We have no idea if it&rsquo;s been hosted and played by other people independently in this time. But a few weeks ago, my friend hosted a server for it, and people still like the game!
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-09-03-september-status/">September Status</a></h2>
    Day 3 of September. Things are going OK for me, I just wanted to write down here what I&rsquo;m aiming for this month. Right now, I&rsquo;m focusing on college applications and web development projects, so Roblox stuff will keep taking a back seat.
I wrote on my Projects page that the new Project Micrathena will resume development this month. I hope I will find time to work on it, but it will likely be at the end of September, and not the start as hoped.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2022-11-02-spooking-out-modern-roblox-port/">Spooking Out&#39;s Modern Roblox Port</a></h2>
