    <h2><a href="/notes/2024-04-04-drafts/">Saving drafts</a></h2>
    Sometimes I have a fragment of a thought about something. Like my mind has a point to make, or I just have the idea for something slightly poetical or writing-y.
And I would just let it go, because&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, actually. Probably I didn&rsquo;t care enough to write it down when I got the opportunity too.
I decided yesterday to just start writing these down. I already journal a little bit, but I feel like writing down these thoughts is something important I should do.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-12-31-reflection-2023/">Reflecting on 2023</a></h2>
    Since 2023 is over in a few days, I want to recap what happened in 2023.
It is 10:44PM, and I am rushing this post out. So it won&rsquo;t be long, or edited. Expect a part 2 post tomorrow.
Stats I made 39 posts, wow!! 9 blog posts (including this one) 22 notes 8 devlogs Plus 4 blog post drafts and 8 note drafts I reached 123 followers on Mastodon (thank you, everyone!
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-12-26-bookwyrm/">I&#39;m joining Bookwyrm üìñ</a></h2>
    I said I&rsquo;ve been getting back into reading books. Now I&rsquo;m on Bookwyrm, so you can keep up with what I&rsquo;m reading, because I keep being lazy about writing posts for them. üôè
If you want to follow me:
@jame@bookwyrm.social RSS feed if you&rsquo;re outside of the whole newfangled Fediverse thingy What is Bookwyrm? Bookwyrm is a social network for books (like Goodreads). So you can catalogue all your books on the website, give reviews and status updates, it&rsquo;s pretty cool!
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-12-25-christmas/">Christmas</a></h2>
    Hope it was a good one. I know mine was. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Here&rsquo;s my gift to readers, and to myself: I will write a new post every day until New Years. So stay tuned!
That&rsquo;s all for now,

    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-12-08-december-reading/">Reading this month</a></h2>
    I&rsquo;ve been reading a bit every day this month, so I&rsquo;ll be blogging each week about the books.
I&rsquo;ll say more in the first week&rsquo;s article, but I try to find books I&rsquo;ve never heard of and seem interesting when I&rsquo;m at the library.
In other words, I&rsquo;m not trying to read all of these books, but explore them. Even if you give up on a book, or simply skim it, you still gain something, I think.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-11-25-smartwatch/">Wanna cut down on phone usage? Try a smartwatch!</a></h2>
    Buy an expensive companion for your phone, and that&rsquo;ll lead you to use your phone less? It sounds like an oxymoron. But after over a month of using my Google Pixel Watch, it seems to be true!
So, yeah. I&rsquo;ve been dealing with spending more time on my phone than I&rsquo;d like. And I try stuff like time tracking apps, blocking, etc. but nothing works. Quite simply, if my phone was there, I would be on it, such as before going to bed and then immediately waking up.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-11-08-hi/">hi</a></h2>
    I wanted to write another daily note. (I&rsquo;ve been meaning to.)
I&rsquo;m not dead. That&rsquo;s the most important thing! Now you know.
I don&rsquo;t have anything to show for any projects at the moment. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I haven&rsquo;t done anything or I&rsquo;ve abandoned them; just that they aren&rsquo;t complete enough to present.
That&rsquo;s the reason there haven&rsquo;t been any blog/devlog posts. For the near future, I only want to share completed work and not just discuss what I&rsquo;m dreaming of.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-11-1-spooking-out-1-year/">Spooking Out 1 year anniversary!</a></h2>
    November is upon us! Did you have a good Halloween? And are you aware that Spooking Out, the 2010 Roblox game by me and a friend, is now a year old (give or take a few days)?
We have no idea if it&rsquo;s been hosted and played by other people independently in this time. But a few weeks ago, my friend hosted a server for it, and people still like the game!
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-09-03-september-status/">September Status</a></h2>
    Day 3 of September. Things are going OK for me, I just wanted to write down here what I&rsquo;m aiming for this month. Right now, I&rsquo;m focusing on college applications and web development projects, so Roblox stuff will keep taking a back seat.
I wrote on my Projects page that the new Project Micrathena will resume development this month. I hope I will find time to work on it, but it will likely be at the end of September, and not the start as hoped.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-07-10-wa/">Seattle</a></h2>
    ‚ô´ Soul of Freedom - Uyama Hiroto + Cise Starr ‚ô´ The trip was a few weeks ago. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write this blog post since the day I got home, but having time to reflect isn&rsquo;t a bad thing.
Washington is great! I used to live here, and it&rsquo;s still a very cool place. The colleges, too.
If you don&rsquo;t care too much about lore you can skip to here for pretty pictures.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-06-18-tn/">Tennessee and journaling to process what is beyond</a></h2>
    ‚ô´ Airporter - Shing02 &amp; Marcus D ‚ô´ As I write this, in 6 hours, I&rsquo;m heading to the airport and departing for Seattle, Washington.
I used to live in Washington, specifically a city nearby Seattle. My close family moved to Florida a few years ago, and I don&rsquo;t feel at home here. Maybe, I&hellip; move back?
I&rsquo;ve thought about it for a very long time. A trip to revisit the place would be a great start instead of jumping straight in with packing my bags and moving (Not like I can even do that without substantial effort and devotion).
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-10-11-cold-nights/">Cold nights in Florida</a></h2>
    I thought to write something about this because someone on Mastodon noted it in a post: the nights in Florida are growing cold. He wrote a thread that I&rsquo;d like to share, about a change in pace for the place I live.

In wonderful news my window is open and air that‚Äôs around 20C / 69F is breezing its way in. That makes me very happy.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2024-03-31-goodnight/">Good night</a></h2>
    I wish you well.
Moving to the next quarter of this year, April to the end of June.
So much inactivity, struggle, I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;
It&rsquo;s beginning to set in how much nothing has happened in 2024 so far. I cannot remember anything of value really occuring these last few months despite a general feeling of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been getting better at life I guess&rdquo; and even then?
I&rsquo;m leaving for college this year, but will things change even then?
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-09-28-blog-more/">I need to blog more</a></h2>
    I have a lot of ideas for daily notes while my blog is collecting dust. Why? I think it comes down to being too lazy for the detail I want to put into blog posts - which ends up leaving my blog not having any blog posts. I really just need to lower my standards and write.
I made this notes section to encourage faster writing, but it makes me question how exact the separation is.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-10-15-space-coast/">Robotics competition and solar eclipse and stuff</a></h2>
    On Saturday, September 14, I went to the Space Coast Showdown, an off-season robotics competition with my team.
I say &ldquo;my&rdquo; team, but I am new to the club. It was worth it to take the whole day off to be there and support everyone. I also learned a lot for how I can help contribute in the feature, as well as what competitions are truly like!

    <h2><a href="/notes/2024-03-14-simple-layout-thoughts/">Thinking about the simple layout</a></h2>
    I think it&rsquo;s kinda funny that I am motivated to make this alternate version, but not to actually write posts.
That&rsquo;s what I was thinking while making it: ok, I can access this site from anywhere. But what is there to read?
I feel like this is a common occurence with a lot of blogs out there, especially ones by web developers: most likely only a few posts, and the majority of them are simply explaining how the site was implemented, in whatever static site generator or CSS styling they picked.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-10-01-where-are-the-notes/">Where are the daily notes?</a></h2>
    Short answer: I&rsquo;ve been spending my time working on Micrathena!
I still haven&rsquo;t gotten into a good schedule of finding time to write blog posts. These past few weeks, the time I devote to working on projects has been spent almost completely on Micrathena. (Or, just slacking off from it). So that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s been a lack of &ldquo;thought&rdquo; (non-nerd) daily notes.
But what about tech related daily notes? &ldquo;Today I Learned&rdquo; posts, right?
