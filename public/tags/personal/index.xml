      <description>Sometimes I have a fragment of a thought about something. Like my mind has a point to make, or I just have the idea for something slightly poetical or writing-y.&#xA;And I would just let it go, because&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know, actually. Probably I didn&amp;rsquo;t care enough to write it down when I got the opportunity too.&#xA;I decided yesterday to just start writing these down. I already journal a little bit, but I feel like writing down these thoughts is something important I should do.</description>

      <description>Since 2023 is over in a few days, I want to recap what happened in 2023.&#xA;It is 10:44PM, and I am rushing this post out. So it won&amp;rsquo;t be long, or edited. Expect a part 2 post tomorrow.&#xA;Stats I made 39 posts, wow!! 9 blog posts (including this one) 22 notes 8 devlogs Plus 4 blog post drafts and 8 note drafts I reached 123 followers on Mastodon (thank you, everyone!</description>

      <description>I said I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting back into reading books. Now I&amp;rsquo;m on Bookwyrm, so you can keep up with what I&amp;rsquo;m reading, because I keep being lazy about writing posts for them. üôè&#xA;If you want to follow me:&#xA;@jame@bookwyrm.social RSS feed if you&amp;rsquo;re outside of the whole newfangled Fediverse thingy What is Bookwyrm? Bookwyrm is a social network for books (like Goodreads). So you can catalogue all your books on the website, give reviews and status updates, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a bit every day this month, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be blogging each week about the books.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll say more in the first week&amp;rsquo;s article, but I try to find books I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of and seem interesting when I&amp;rsquo;m at the library.&#xA;In other words, I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to read all of these books, but explore them. Even if you give up on a book, or simply skim it, you still gain something, I think.</description>

      <title>Wanna cut down on phone usage? Try a smartwatch!</title>

      <description>Buy an expensive companion for your phone, and that&amp;rsquo;ll lead you to use your phone less? It sounds like an oxymoron. But after over a month of using my Google Pixel Watch, it seems to be true!&#xA;So, yeah. I&amp;rsquo;ve been dealing with spending more time on my phone than I&amp;rsquo;d like. And I try stuff like time tracking apps, blocking, etc. but nothing works. Quite simply, if my phone was there, I would be on it, such as before going to bed and then immediately waking up.</description>

      <description>I wanted to write another daily note. (I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to.)&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m not dead. That&amp;rsquo;s the most important thing! Now you know.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to show for any projects at the moment. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything or I&amp;rsquo;ve abandoned them; just that they aren&amp;rsquo;t complete enough to present.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s the reason there haven&amp;rsquo;t been any blog/devlog posts. For the near future, I only want to share completed work and not just discuss what I&amp;rsquo;m dreaming of.</description>

      <description>November is upon us! Did you have a good Halloween? And are you aware that Spooking Out, the 2010 Roblox game by me and a friend, is now a year old (give or take a few days)?&#xA;We have no idea if it&amp;rsquo;s been hosted and played by other people independently in this time. But a few weeks ago, my friend hosted a server for it, and people still like the game!</description>

      <description>Day 3 of September. Things are going OK for me, I just wanted to write down here what I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for this month. Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m focusing on college applications and web development projects, so Roblox stuff will keep taking a back seat.&#xA;I wrote on my Projects page that the new Project Micrathena will resume development this month. I hope I will find time to work on it, but it will likely be at the end of September, and not the start as hoped.</description>

      <description>‚ô´ Soul of Freedom - Uyama Hiroto + Cise Starr ‚ô´ The trip was a few weeks ago. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write this blog post since the day I got home, but having time to reflect isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad thing.&#xA;Washington is great! I used to live here, and it&amp;rsquo;s still a very cool place. The colleges, too.&#xA;If you don&amp;rsquo;t care too much about lore you can skip to here for pretty pictures.</description>

      <description>‚ô´ Airporter - Shing02 &amp;amp; Marcus D ‚ô´ As I write this, in 6 hours, I&amp;rsquo;m heading to the airport and departing for Seattle, Washington.&#xA;I used to live in Washington, specifically a city nearby Seattle. My close family moved to Florida a few years ago, and I don&amp;rsquo;t feel at home here. Maybe, I&amp;hellip; move back?&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about it for a very long time. A trip to revisit the place would be a great start instead of jumping straight in with packing my bags and moving (Not like I can even do that without substantial effort and devotion).</description>

      <description>I thought to write something about this because someone on Mastodon noted it in a post: the nights in Florida are growing cold. He wrote a thread that I&amp;rsquo;d like to share, about a change in pace for the place I live.&#xA;RüéÉB üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà RMiddleton.art (@RMiddleton@mastodon.art) Sep 29:&#xA;In wonderful news my window is open and air that‚Äôs around 20C / 69F is breezing its way in. That makes me very happy.</description>

      <description>I wish you well.&#xA;Moving to the next quarter of this year, April to the end of June.&#xA;So much inactivity, struggle, I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip;&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s beginning to set in how much nothing has happened in 2024 so far. I cannot remember anything of value really occuring these last few months despite a general feeling of &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting better at life I guess&amp;rdquo; and even then?&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m leaving for college this year, but will things change even then?</description>

      <title>I need to blog more</title>

      <description>I have a lot of ideas for daily notes while my blog is collecting dust. Why? I think it comes down to being too lazy for the detail I want to put into blog posts - which ends up leaving my blog not having any blog posts. I really just need to lower my standards and write.&#xA;I made this notes section to encourage faster writing, but it makes me question how exact the separation is.</description>

      <description>On Saturday, September 14, I went to the Space Coast Showdown, an off-season robotics competition with my team.&#xA;I say &amp;ldquo;my&amp;rdquo; team, but I am new to the club. It was worth it to take the whole day off to be there and support everyone. I also learned a lot for how I can help contribute in the feature, as well as what competitions are truly like!&#xA;{% include image.html url=&amp;quot;/blog/media/spacecoast-place_small.</description>

      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s kinda funny that I am motivated to make this alternate version, but not to actually write posts.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s what I was thinking while making it: ok, I can access this site from anywhere. But what is there to read?&#xA;I feel like this is a common occurence with a lot of blogs out there, especially ones by web developers: most likely only a few posts, and the majority of them are simply explaining how the site was implemented, in whatever static site generator or CSS styling they picked.</description>

      <title>Where are the daily notes?</title>

      <description>Short answer: I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending my time working on Micrathena!&#xA;I still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten into a good schedule of finding time to write blog posts. These past few weeks, the time I devote to working on projects has been spent almost completely on Micrathena. (Or, just slacking off from it). So that&amp;rsquo;s why there&amp;rsquo;s been a lack of &amp;ldquo;thought&amp;rdquo; (non-nerd) daily notes.&#xA;But what about tech related daily notes? &amp;ldquo;Today I Learned&amp;rdquo; posts, right?</description>
