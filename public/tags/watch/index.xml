      <description>Buy an expensive companion for your phone, and that&amp;rsquo;ll lead you to use your phone less? It sounds like an oxymoron. But after over a month of using my Google Pixel Watch, it seems to be true!&#xA;So, yeah. I&amp;rsquo;ve been dealing with spending more time on my phone than I&amp;rsquo;d like. And I try stuff like time tracking apps, blocking, etc. but nothing works. Quite simply, if my phone was there, I would be on it, such as before going to bed and then immediately waking up.</description>
