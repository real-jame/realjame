      <description>Sometimes I have a fragment of a thought about something. Like my mind has a point to make, or I just have the idea for something slightly poetical or writing-y.&#xA;And I would just let it go, because&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know, actually. Probably I didn&amp;rsquo;t care enough to write it down when I got the opportunity too.&#xA;I decided yesterday to just start writing these down. I already journal a little bit, but I feel like writing down these thoughts is something important I should do.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not (currently) a full-on writer in my eyes, but I still write a lot of blog posts, and essays in school. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed I use writing apps that come without any &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; features like spell check, auto correct, etc. But is it really a good thing to have?&#xA;I just write blog posts in my code editor, Visual Studio Code. It does the job, and writing Markdown anywhere else might cause issues because of which features are supported by which editors.</description>
