    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-12-27-snowstorm/">Website snowstorm effect</a></h2>
    For the holidays, I added a simple snowing effect.
It&rsquo;s not actually my code, but I did make a simple control to toggle the snow effect.
Adding the snowing effect I was playing around with the classic snowstorm.js script by Scott Schiller, but I could never get it to properly turn on and off without requiring a page reload when making button. Plus, it always looked super distracting no matter what I did.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-11-21-glorification/">Will people glorify the current internet in 20 years?</a></h2>
    For the last few years, there&rsquo;s been low-stakes movements to rediscover the aesthetics and values that composed of the Web 1.0 era internet - that is, from the 90s to the early/mid 2000s.
{% include image.html url=&quot;/note/media/glorification-neocities.jpg&quot; alt=&ldquo;Index page for websites people have made on Neocities&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Neocities is a modern-day platform for website creation and hosting, which people commonly use for their personal, sometimes Web 1.0 themed, websites.&rdquo; %}
I find it fun, why do you think this site is here in the first place?
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-09-25-corru-observer/">Thoughts on corru.observer (it&#39;s very cool)</a></h2>
    corru.observer is a very strange website. It&rsquo;s an interactive story that&rsquo;s part 3D game, part visual novel, part website. Hypertext fiction at its finest.
When I stumbled across it, I basically spent the rest of my night playing it for 3 hours straight. It&rsquo;s right up my wheelhouse, and great stuff!! I really do not want to say anything about what corru.observer is about. If you think you are interested, stop reading and play it now.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-09-12-web-frameworks/">⚛️ React: When everything looks like a nail...</a></h2>
    I&rsquo;ve been working on textarea.site as a way to dive back into the beautiful and the ugly parts of front-end web development. After a few days of work, I decided to rewrite the entire project in Svelte. Surprising? Maybe not. It&rsquo;s about the right tool for the job, and here, React is not it.
I&rsquo;m sure people have written countless times about this. But it&rsquo;s true that being versatile is one of the best skills you can have as a software developer.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-08-30-update-3/">Update III - A Complete Redesign</a></h2>
    Hello, this time I don&rsquo;t want to write about myself too much. Just the website. I&rsquo;ve spent almost 2 weeks now working on this big redesign, I really hope you like it!
There&rsquo;s a sidebar instead of the old header. I think it&rsquo;s a more effective use of desktop screen space, and on mobile, it turns into a horizontally scrolling top bar! I was inspired by Zenith&rsquo;s website in terms of design.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2024-03-14-opera8-quirks/">2 Opera 8 quirks with the simple layout</a></h2>
    I was testing this with Opera 8. I wasn&rsquo;t sure which version the DSi browser was built on (my target when making this layout), so I just went for the lowest one, and a bit lower to be safe: Opera 8.
So, here are 2 quick little quirks I noticed that occured in Opera 8, but not in my modern browser.
I could put clean this up but I&rsquo;m lazy and I&rsquo;ll just share the quick notes I took.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2024-03-13-simple-layout/">Simple layout, why not?</a></h2>
    I made an alternate, minimal version of my website. You can find it on the sidebar, or head to simple.realja.me.
{% include image.html url=&quot;/blog/media/simple-home_small.png&quot; alt=&ldquo;Screenshot of the simple layout&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Rendered in Opera 8, a browser from 2005&rdquo; %}
Now, you can read my website on practically any web browser and device ever made!

    <h2><a href="/notes/2024-03-14-simple-layout-thoughts/">Thinking about the simple layout</a></h2>
    I think it&rsquo;s kinda funny that I am motivated to make this alternate version, but not to actually write posts.
That&rsquo;s what I was thinking while making it: ok, I can access this site from anywhere. But what is there to read?
I feel like this is a common occurence with a lot of blogs out there, especially ones by web developers: most likely only a few posts, and the majority of them are simply explaining how the site was implemented, in whatever static site generator or CSS styling they picked.
