      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on textarea.site as a way to dive back into the beautiful and the ugly parts of front-end web development. After a few days of work, I decided to rewrite the entire project in Svelte. Surprising? Maybe not. It&amp;rsquo;s about the right tool for the job, and here, React is not it.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m sure people have written countless times about this. But it&amp;rsquo;s true that being versatile is one of the best skills you can have as a software developer.</description>

      <description>Day 3 of September. Things are going OK for me, I just wanted to write down here what I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for this month. Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m focusing on college applications and web development projects, so Roblox stuff will keep taking a back seat.&#xA;I wrote on my Projects page that the new Project Micrathena will resume development this month. I hope I will find time to work on it, but it will likely be at the end of September, and not the start as hoped.</description>
