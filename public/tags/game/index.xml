      <description>corru.observer is a very strange website. It&amp;rsquo;s an interactive story that&amp;rsquo;s part 3D game, part visual novel, part website. Hypertext fiction at its finest.&#xA;When I stumbled across it, I basically spent the rest of my night playing it for 3 hours straight. It&amp;rsquo;s right up my wheelhouse, and great stuff!! I really do not want to say anything about what corru.observer is about. If you think you are interested, stop reading and play it now.</description>

      <description>Can you do it? Click to Ten is a game I found on my friend&amp;rsquo;s Steam profile - he only had 1 minute of playtime, yet he told me he beat it! How can that be? Is it really that easy to click to ten?&#xA;I had to find out. And the game was free, too.&#xA;Look at the trailer, this game has to be good!&#xA;I installed it, and the worry set in as I slowly clicked.</description>
