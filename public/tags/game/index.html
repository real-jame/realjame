    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-09-25-corru-observer/">Thoughts on corru.observer (it&#39;s very cool)</a></h2>
    corru.observer is a very strange website. It&rsquo;s an interactive story that&rsquo;s part 3D game, part visual novel, part website. Hypertext fiction at its finest.
When I stumbled across it, I basically spent the rest of my night playing it for 3 hours straight. It&rsquo;s right up my wheelhouse, and great stuff!! I really do not want to say anything about what corru.observer is about. If you think you are interested, stop reading and play it now.
  
    <h2><a href="/notes/2023-10-03-click-to-ten/">CLICK TO TEN</a></h2>
    Can you do it? Click to Ten is a game I found on my friend&rsquo;s Steam profile - he only had 1 minute of playtime, yet he told me he beat it! How can that be? Is it really that easy to click to ten?
I had to find out. And the game was free, too.
Look at the trailer, this game has to be good!
I installed it, and the worry set in as I slowly clicked.
