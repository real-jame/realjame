      <description>♫ Soul of Freedom - Uyama Hiroto + Cise Starr ♫ The trip was a few weeks ago. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write this blog post since the day I got home, but having time to reflect isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad thing.&#xA;Washington is great! I used to live here, and it&amp;rsquo;s still a very cool place. The colleges, too.&#xA;If you don&amp;rsquo;t care too much about lore you can skip to here for pretty pictures.</description>

      <description>♫ Airporter - Shing02 &amp;amp; Marcus D ♫ As I write this, in 6 hours, I&amp;rsquo;m heading to the airport and departing for Seattle, Washington.&#xA;I used to live in Washington, specifically a city nearby Seattle. My close family moved to Florida a few years ago, and I don&amp;rsquo;t feel at home here. Maybe, I&amp;hellip; move back?&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about it for a very long time. A trip to revisit the place would be a great start instead of jumping straight in with packing my bags and moving (Not like I can even do that without substantial effort and devotion).</description>
