      <description>I have a lot of ideas for daily notes while my blog is collecting dust. Why? I think it comes down to being too lazy for the detail I want to put into blog posts - which ends up leaving my blog not having any blog posts. I really just need to lower my standards and write.&#xA;I made this notes section to encourage faster writing, but it makes me question how exact the separation is.</description>

      <description>Short answer: I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending my time working on Micrathena!&#xA;I still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten into a good schedule of finding time to write blog posts. These past few weeks, the time I devote to working on projects has been spent almost completely on Micrathena. (Or, just slacking off from it). So that&amp;rsquo;s why there&amp;rsquo;s been a lack of &amp;ldquo;thought&amp;rdquo; (non-nerd) daily notes.&#xA;But what about tech related daily notes? &amp;ldquo;Today I Learned&amp;rdquo; posts, right?</description>
