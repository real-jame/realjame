  <time datetime="0001-01-01T00:00:00&#43;00:00">January 1, 1</time>

  <p>I wish you well.</p>
<p>Moving to the next quarter of this year, April to the end of June.</p>
<p>So much inactivity, struggle, I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beginning to set in how much nothing has happened in 2024 so far. I cannot remember anything of value really occuring these last few months despite a general feeling of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been getting better at life I guess&rdquo; and even then?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaving for college this year, but will things change even then? What I&rsquo;ve been holding out for to change my environment? Or is the haze due to me?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s both?</p>
<p>I can write whatever I want here, and I still don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I would like to journal here more. I&rsquo;ve always thought I shouldn&rsquo;t, but why not.</p>
<p>Not many people may read, but the people who do may come from all sorts of places. Formal or not. It&rsquo;s the formal that worries me.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the problem. It&rsquo;s, I want to maintain a good self-image if I share this for other people, because I don&rsquo;t want it to be totally private.</p>
<p>But I really should just stop caring. This is who I am. Someone who doesn&rsquo;t work, but has a lot of ideas ranging in a lot of topics. Someone who&rsquo;s, I hope, adaptable. I&rsquo;ve needed to be adaptable to live, anyways&hellip;</p>
<p>When the time comes for my life to drastically change, I want to be there for it.</p>
<p>Right now, all I can do is live a life of repetition, but do what I can to break out of it through what I create and learn every day.</p>
<p>Piece by piece, like building a staircase to get over this wall or something. I&rsquo;m too tired for metaphors right now&hellip;</p>
<p>10:45PM.</p>
<p>I have been working on stuff recently.</p>
<p>Random coding projects, like a web app and something that&rsquo;s part Minecraft mod, part Discord bot. Silly sounding, but it&rsquo;s for my friends, and it&rsquo;s made me really happy to be able to do something for my friends in this way.</p>
<p>I always say that&rsquo;s what I like to use programming for. I would like that statement to be more and more true in the long run, so I will try to keep doing things like this.</p>
<p>When I can focus, I really can focus. But it takes the stars to align to get me focused. Otherwise I wallow and do nothing.</p>
<p>I want to find value in the next quarter of my year.</p>
<p>Maybe it isn&rsquo;t important to find concrete value in every day? Like, &ldquo;oh on April 6 I did this&rdquo;. Maybe just, &ldquo;I worked and improved in April, as I did every other month.&rdquo; is enough.</p>
<p>Because when I look back in the start of 2025, I will be so much better than I was in 2024. People around me say that I&rsquo;ve changed so much since 2023, so I guess I&rsquo;m always growing, both consciously and unconsciously.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kinda beautiful.</p>
<hr>
<p>At this point I&rsquo;m talking in circles. I just wanted to write basically a journal entry but this time, on my blog. An uncontrolled stream of thought. There is NO editing on this post, no going back.</p>
<p>With that said, good night.</p>
