  <p>Hey, check out Livakivi on YouTube.</p>
<p>He makes videos about a few topics, such as learning Japanese, learning art, working out, etc. But at their core, he makes videos about self-improvement and working to be better, to expand your mind and body every day.</p>
<p>I was very, very inactive not only on the blog, but on all projects and skills I&rsquo;m learning in November and part of December. What helped me get back into the swing of things and with better disclipine was his videos.</p>
<p>Mainly, these two:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jAUoh2AdIs">Do Art for No Reason at All (Art for Practical People)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3muXFhIyoCU">What if You Had Started Earlier?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>He does also make videos about whatever, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZl_gQumb28">reviewing a mechanical keyboard (An Honest Review of the Lofree Flow)</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYLTtm-WITnmJxIVLsDB-Ns96OGLeVG50">renovating an old Soviet store into an house</a>. Livakivi&rsquo;s channel is a very blog type of channel, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even do weightlifting (I probably should) and Japanese (though I am learning Italian), but I greatly appreciate the way he describes that core topic, self-improvement. There are lots of resources online for getting better, but being able to see someone&rsquo;s growth across weeks, months, even years, told to you in a very personal way, reassures me in a way books, news articles, and other sources don&rsquo;t.</p>
