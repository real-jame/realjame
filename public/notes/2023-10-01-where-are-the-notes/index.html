  <h1>Where are the daily notes?</h1>

  
  
  <time datetime="0001-01-01T00:00:00&#43;00:00">January 1, 1</time>

  <p>Short answer: I&rsquo;ve been spending my time working on <a href="/projects/micrathena">Micrathena</a>!</p>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t gotten into a good schedule of finding time to write blog posts. These past few weeks, the time I devote to working on projects has been spent almost completely on Micrathena. (Or, just slacking off from it). So that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s been a lack of &ldquo;thought&rdquo; (non-nerd) daily notes.</p>
<p>But what about tech related daily notes? &ldquo;Today I Learned&rdquo; posts, right? Well, I actually <em>have</em> been learning a lot from this project, and found several note-worthy topics. But the problem is&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been developing this game in secret! If I make a daily note, I would have to give up aspects of the game for the sake of context (making the context more abstract would make it less clear to understand).</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m still writing daily notes, I just haven&rsquo;t gone all the way through with releasing them yet.</p>
<p>But today, I <em>have</em> decided to just release 2 other posts I&rsquo;ve written as-is.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/note/blog-more.html">I need to blog more - September 28, 2023</a></li>
<li><a href="/note/corru-observer.html">Thoughts on corru.observer (it&rsquo;s very cool) - September 25, 2023</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="oh-and-about-micrathena">Oh, and about Micrathena</h2>
<p>I should do this in a more dedicated post, but I want Micrathena&rsquo;s full reveal to be a <strong>bang</strong> with hopefully a trailer of footage taken from private testing with other people. But I&rsquo;m excited to say that&rsquo;s happening really really soon! I&rsquo;ve been spending the last few days just ironing out any multiplayer-related bugs, and it should be almost ready for other people to try playing on a server by&hellip; maybe even tomorrow! No promises, but the promised reveal should happen this week. (I&rsquo;ve been saying that quite a bit on my Mastodon, but I think I can say it this time with almost complete confidence).</p>
<p>Please stay tuned for more info.</p>
