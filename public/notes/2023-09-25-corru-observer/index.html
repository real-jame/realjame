  <p>corru.observer is a very strange website. It&rsquo;s an interactive story that&rsquo;s part 3D game, part visual novel, part website. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_fiction">Hypertext fiction</a> at its finest.</p>
<p>When I stumbled across it, I basically spent the rest of my night playing it for 3 hours straight. It&rsquo;s right up my wheelhouse, and great stuff!! I really do not want to say <em>anything</em> about what corru.observer is about. <strong>If you think you are interested, stop reading and play it now.</strong></p>

<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really something. Where do I begin?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super creative, and embodies a lot of interesting art styles and storytelling techniques familiar to other &ldquo;indie web&rdquo; projects, such as NeoCities websites (where this is hosted!) and the work of artists such as <a href="https://vlif.neocities.org">VLIF</a>.</p>
<p>The constant changing of how you interact with the game - from 3D to dialogue interactions to RPG battles is incredibly engaging to me, and is something I would like to do if I ever make something like this.</p>
<p>Writing&hellip; worldbuilding&hellip; it makes my head spin with how deep it goes, mainly lore. The creator developed the alien species really well in a way that makes you reflect on what is considered &ldquo;normal&rdquo; in human society, right? At least, that&rsquo;s what I took from it. This is one of my favorite storytelling techniques, is when you&rsquo;re right in the middle of everything, you know next to nothing, but as the story develops you start piecing together the elements. Such as finding out the cyst is a sort of Google Glass brain implant thingy, what the alien figures of speech mean, etc. It&rsquo;s super engaging.</p>
<p>But speaking of writing, story-wise, is there a message or moral in here? I still love it from an art perspective, but in my head the story just seems like&hellip; a series of events. Oh well. The story isn&rsquo;t finished, anyways, so we&rsquo;ll have to see how it wraps up.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t play all of it - honestly I got a bit tired of the RPG gameplay but that was due to me doing everything up to that point in one sitting. But I&rsquo;ve seen gameplay of the rest, and all in all, corru.observer is very swag, go try it and show the creator some love, they have a <a href="https://twitter.com/CorruWorks">Twitter</a> and a <a href="https://corru.works">website</a>. That&rsquo;s all from me today!</p>
