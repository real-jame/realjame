  <p>I think it&rsquo;s kinda funny that I am motivated to make this alternate version, but not to actually write posts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was thinking while making it: ok, I can access this site from anywhere. But what is there to read?</p>
<p>I feel like this is a common occurence with a lot of blogs out there, especially ones by web developers: most likely only a few posts, and the majority of them are simply explaining how the site was implemented, in whatever static site generator or CSS styling they picked. Nothing about, say, life&hellip; advice&hellip; anything that isn&rsquo;t about the website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to appreciate what goes into a website, but I would like to gain knowledge or feel something in regards to other stuff too!</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s the thing. Because I don&rsquo;t have motivation to write other kinds of posts, and because I want to put writing posts over tending to the website, it leaves me with inactivity.</p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t be so concerned about that stuff. After all, it was honestly really fun to work on my website again as well as work with old browsers and tech in this way! It&rsquo;s a really fun interest of mine, after all.</p>
<p>Maybe if I want to just tend to my website for the fun of it, I should let myself enjoy that as a hobby.</p>
<h2 id="about-motivation">About motivation</h2>
<p>Motivating myself to do personal projects is really really hard!! (Notice how I get nothing completed ever?)</p>
<p>With that said, simply engaging with the project, no matter how minor, is really helpful to do it.</p>
<p>I learned that trick from the creator of <a href="https://corru.observer">corru.observer</a> (which is a very cool thing and you should check it out, but that&rsquo;s unrelated): just &ldquo;touch it&rdquo;. Not just think about doing it, but it&rsquo;s not about working on it either. Just <strong>visit your project</strong>. Open it in your code editor, your image editor, video editor, text editor. It could be physical too: get out that journal/(note,sketch,text)-book to the page your project resides on. Visit it. Touch it. That&rsquo;s it! Then, try to engage with it in an enjoyable way.</p>
<p>Clearly, sitting down to write a post is not what helps me engage with my website. I can think about what I want to write throughout the day, but I can never motivate myself to specifically sit down and write.</p>
<p>But when I start touching my website by opening up the project in my editor, and I start engaging with it by, in this case, fiddling around with an alternate layout, that&rsquo;s when I can get motivated.</p>
<p>And now, here I am, at the end of this note which I wrote in a single sitting.</p>
<p>Resolve to touch your projects if you hope to finish them. Don&rsquo;t let them slip away to inactivity!</p>
