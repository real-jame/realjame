  <h1>Will people glorify the current internet in 20 years?</h1>

  <p>For the last few years, there&rsquo;s been low-stakes movements to rediscover the aesthetics and values that composed of the Web 1.0 era internet - that is, from the 90s to the early/mid 2000s.</p>

<p>{% include image.html url=&quot;/note/media/glorification-neocities.jpg&quot; alt=&ldquo;Index page for websites people have made on Neocities&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Neocities is a modern-day platform for website creation and hosting, which people commonly use for their personal, sometimes Web 1.0 themed, websites.&rdquo; %}</p>
<p>I find it fun, why do you think this site is here in the first place? I was inspired by stuff like this.</p>
<p>Throughout history, people have adored whatever was in the past, to a rose-tinted degree. <a href="https://www.fibremood.com/en/blog/trends/20-years-does-the-trick">Fashion seems to adore whatever was fashionable 20 years ago</a>. And as stated, people are adoring the 20+ year old web.</p>
<p>But in 20 years from now, will people really be looking back on the internet we have now with admiration?</p>
<p>Well, maybe if the web gets even worse&hellip; which it definitely can.</p>
<p>Or maybe the web gets better? Which is a statement that means something different to everyone.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t really predict the future, can we? Even if people do manage to glorify the late 2010s / early 2020s web, or if they don&rsquo;t, I bet it&rsquo;ll be for a reason we couldn&rsquo;t possibly have guessed.</p>
<p>For now, I&rsquo;ll just enjoy this wave.</p>
