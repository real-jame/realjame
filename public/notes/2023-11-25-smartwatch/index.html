  <p>Buy an expensive companion for your phone, and that&rsquo;ll lead you to use your phone <em>less</em>? It sounds like an oxymoron. But after over a month of using my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_Watch">Google Pixel Watch</a>, it seems to be true!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So, yeah. I&rsquo;ve been dealing with spending more time on my phone than I&rsquo;d like. And I try stuff like time tracking apps, blocking, etc. but nothing works. Quite simply, if my phone was there, I would be on it, such as before going to bed and then immediately waking up.</p>
<p>The problem is, I rely on my phone for certain things. Mainly, getting texts from my parents. This is the thing about smartphones - they&rsquo;re all-in-one almost to a fault at times.</p>
<p>After all, a common solution for this is to simply keep your phone out of your room when you sleep. But now I can&rsquo;t receive texts from my parents. And now I don&rsquo;t have an alarm clock either!</p>
<h2 id="introducing-the-smartwatch">Introducing the smartwatch</h2>
<p>Smartwatches seem to be equally good for 3 different things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health and fitness tracking</li>
<li>A remote control and display for your phone&rsquo;s media player and driving navigations</li>
<li>A replacement for your phone at times (e.g. going out for a walk)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are useful, but it&rsquo;s that 3rd thing that&rsquo;s super helpful in this situation. Thanks to my watch being tethered to my phone, I can send and receive text messages and voice calls.</p>
<p>Plus, it&rsquo;s the best alarm clock I&rsquo;ve ever owned. Seriously! It being directly pressing and buzzing against your wrist is super effective at waking me up - no audio needed, so I don&rsquo;t have to annoy anyone with a loud alarm.</p>
<h2 id="about-price">About price</h2>
<p>Smartwatches can be expensive though. My reasoning probably sounds unnecessary to most. But just know it&rsquo;s not impossible to get great deals on a smartwatch if you really want one.</p>
<p>Officially, the Apple Watch SE seems like a crazy low price for the value - 249 for Wi-Fi only or 299 for LTE.</p>
<p>On the Android side, the Google Pixel Watch 2 released recently, so Google is marking the first generation decently low - 280 Wi-Fi and 330 LTE.</p>
<p>Other manufacturers are probably doing stuff too, mainly Samsung. I wasn&rsquo;t really paying attention to those because I wanted the strongest integration with my Google Pixel phone.</p>
<p><strong>But of course, the best place to get one is used.</strong></p>
<p>I got my LTE Pixel Watch from eBay for $160 by making an offer on a buy-it-now listing, but they seem to go anywhere from $100-200 on both eBay and Facebook Marketplace. So be vigilant on both platforms for a good deal. I hunted for maybe a week or two.</p>
<p>{% include callout.html type=&ldquo;note&rdquo; content=&ldquo;The Pixel Watch also comes with 6 months of Fitbit Premium. Weirdly, when I set up my Watch, it <em>did</em> give me the offer. Maybe I got lucky and bought it from someone who never used it? Or does Google just offer it to any Google account who sets up a Pixel Watch? Not sure.&rdquo; %}</p>
<p>Scams are rare but possible, plus you don&rsquo;t get warranty buying second-hand. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23874281/google-pixel-watch-cracks-no-repairs-warranty">Not like Google repairs the Pixel Watch, though.</a></p>
<h2 id="end">End</h2>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll write a daily note specifically about my experiences about the Pixel Watch, but I&rsquo;ll leave it at that for now.</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s a pretty nice pager for your phone. ðŸ“Ÿ</p>
