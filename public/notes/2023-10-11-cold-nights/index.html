<p>I thought to write something about this because someone on Mastodon noted it in a post: the nights in Florida are growing cold. He wrote a thread that I&rsquo;d like to share, about a change in pace for the place I live.</p>

Sep 29:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In wonderful news my window is open and air that‚Äôs around 20C / 69F is breezing its way in. That makes me very happy.
Window is still open. All day the breeze has been terrific. I live in Florida! (Northeast) October-April can be really wonderful here. (Strictly talking about weather. The people and the government are atrocious.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sep 30:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another day in the comfort zone of no heat &amp; no AC. I probably won‚Äôt continue to post every cool and comfortable day in a toot, but I am noting them in my calendar. It‚Äôs a form of gratitude journaling. There is a lot I don‚Äôt like about my building, town, county, state, and nation. If it were easy I would live elsewhere with no hesitation. Reminding myself of what feels good about here helps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oct 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I‚Äôm feeling kinda down today I‚Äôll return to the comfortable weather. The breezes continue. Windows open for at least the last 72 hours here in northeast Florida. It‚Äôs 6:45 pm and I just decided I need socks to warm my tootsies. (Going barefoot at home is my preference for keeping cool during summer.)
The weather cycle happens every year and every year it‚Äôs a pleasant surprise!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh! Also today my bed received a cover for the first time since May. My summer bedding is cool sheets only. (I don‚Äôt use AC any more than I have to.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally Oct 6, where I saw the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Going on one week of 24/7 fully open windows, no heat or AC, here in northeast Florida (Jacksonville). I like keeping track of this info so I am entering Perfect Weather as an all day event into my calendar, set to repeat yearly. Next year I can compare.

</blockquote>
<p>Amazing! I actually happen to live near Jacksonville, so I opened my window at night and&hellip;</p>
<p>I relished as the elusive chill filled my room. That was one of the best nights of sleep I&rsquo;ve had in years.</p>
<p>It makes me think back to Washington. After all, cold like that is the norm, not relegated to a few weeks or months a year.</p>
<p>I hope to move back someday. However long it will take.</p>

<p><em>Things are tolerable for a change, but for how long?</em></p>
<p>{% include image.html url=&quot;/note/media/cold-nights-weather.png&quot; alt=&ldquo;Weather forecast for my location. Slowly, the days are spiking back up to a high of 88 degrees Fahrenheit.&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Almost 90 degrees&hellip; just what I wanted. At least the nights will still be somewhat cold.&rdquo; %}</p>
