  <p>I have a lot of ideas for daily notes while my blog is collecting dust. Why? I think it comes down to being too lazy for the detail I want to put into blog posts - which ends up leaving my blog not having any blog posts. I really just need to lower my standards and <em>write</em>.</p>
<p>I made this notes section to encourage faster writing, but it makes me question how exact the separation is. Between nerd writing and non-nerd writing that is, and I do want to do more non-nerd writing. I&rsquo;m not a big fan of the countless vapid blog sites by tech workers who only write about the most mundane boring things relating to, like, web frameworks or whatever. Right?</p>
<p>And that writing is useful, and important, but I really just want a mix of that in addition to other things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start using the blog section more, even if the posts aren&rsquo;t as in-depth or have as many images as before. (Really, images are what costs so much time&hellip; seriously)</p>
<p>So basically, daily notes are primarily short nerd stuff that doesn&rsquo;t really have a major moral or informative takeaway, it&rsquo;s just&hellip; to note something down.</p>
